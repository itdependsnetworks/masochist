                <p>
                  I've been looking all over for a feature and just can't find a
                  good workable solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I (and apparently many others from what I've read) have a
                  server mac that houses my music collection and pipes sound
                  (both wirelessly and not) around my home. I use and love
                  Synergy, but it does me no good while its running on a server
                  in the other room.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Is there any chance of you adding the ability to control
                  another machine via Synergy? This would be the perfect
                  solution for me - all of the Synergy controls and
                  notifications I love, controlling my music from anywhere in
                  the house.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've tried the other options, and they all either a) don't
                  work, or b) are clunky and lack the intrusive cleanness of
                  Synergy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You'd have a ready-made market - no one is doing this job
                  well, lots of folks are using mp3 as their main music source.
                  It definitely seems a logical extension of Synergy's
                  capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>I'd be more than willing to help test things out!</p>
                <p>Thanks, -Tim</p>
