          a business selling software on the Internet. These things often start
          out as hobbies, but as they become more serious, the costs (and
          potential benefits) start to rise as well. You may not be aware of
          some of these costs until you first stumble across them. So I'll list
          some of these costs as well as some hints on how to minimize them, and
          hopefully stay in business!

            <h4>Net access</h4>

            <p>
              Your customers will expect prompt replies from you, so that means
              having always-on net access from your place of business. It's also
              helpful from a development perspective to have access to online
              documentation when you need it. Broadband is strongly recommended,
              and is more or less essential if you hope to do large downloads
              (like Mac OS X software seeds or updates to the Xcode Tools).
            </p>

            <h4>Hosting</h4>

            <p>
              To distribute your software and provide information to potential
              users you'll need proper hosting for your website. It's important
              to go with a reputable ISP who can provide reliable connectivity.
              At the hobby end of the spectrum, you can use the web space that
              is most likely bundled with your Internet access. As your software
              becomes more popular you will probably overshoot the bandwidth
              allowance of your provider and have to move to something more
              substantial.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can pay for standard web hosting packages, virtual server
              packages, dedicated hosting (an entire machine all to yourself),
              and server colocation (where you provide the server and your ISP
              gives you space for it in its data center). As you move up the
              scale you pay more, but you get more control over the hosting. By
              the time you get into server colocation, you've got complete
              control over everything: you choose the OS and install it yourself
              and you configure and tailor every aspect of the server. This
              control comes at a price; you'll have to invest more time in
              setting things up, and the colocation fees will be high too.
            </p>

            <p>
              I think that I definitely broke with the normal pattern for
              shareware authors when I started out, because I went down the
              server colocation path back in 2002, before I even released my
              first product. At that point I had already been running the
              website for several
              years, out of my own pocket. I had had a long run of troubles with
              unreliable hosts: sharing the machine with thousands of other
              sites, unreliable or downright broken email, down time, lack of
              control, poor security. I was absolutely sick of it. For me it was
              worth it to buy a server out of my own funds and arrange
              colocation for me to be rid of all those problems. And I am very
              glad that I did it, as I never have any problems with the server.
              And if I do have a problem, it's always my own fault, and I can
              always fix it (rather than wait for someone else to fix it).
            </p>

            <p>
              No matter which hosting option you choose, you'll want to minimize
              your bandwidth costs. One of the best ways to do this is to
              recruit mirrors. In my own case this has been particularly
              critical because my server is in Australia, where bandwidth is
              still charged at the insane rate of 10 cents per megabyte. I also
              pay for hosting with
              <a href="http://www.pair.com/">pair.com</a> over in the US where
              bandwidth is cheaper. That server hosts many of
              the images for this website as well as downloadable files. By
              spending a little extra money in the US I can hopefully reduce my
              Australian bandwidth bill. Pair is not the cheapest, but they have
              a good reputation and that's important to me after my prior
              negative experiences. And I only get them to host vanilla files
              served straight from Apache (no MySQL or PHP).
            </p>

            <h4>Server hardware</h4>

            <p>
              If you go down the path of server colocation, as I did, you'll
              need to buy a server. It's possible to cut corners and save money
              here, but I don't think it's worth the peace of mind. I recommend
              buying a complete package from an established vendor, like
              <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>. Buy a 1RU (one rack unit)
              server, because ISPs often charge you more when your equipment
              takes up more slots in the rack.
            </p>

            <p>
              The IBM
              <a href="http://www.ibm.com/pc/us/eserver/xseries/">xSeries</a>
              presents remarkably good value for money. For example, at the time
              of writing you can pick up their xSeries 306 (equipped with a
              2.8GHz Pentium 4, 1MB cache, 512MB RAM, 36GB 10,000RPM SCSI disk
              drive, and CD-ROM) for $1,309, or less than half the cost of the
              cheapest <a href="http://www.apple.com/xserve/">Xserve</a> sold by
              Apple ($2,999). A machine like this is more than enough to serve
              the average website.
            </p>

            <p>
              Like most things in this business, as you get more serious you can
              (and probably should) spend more money. You may buy a single
              server the first time around, but as your business grows you may
              decide to purchase two servers the next time, and set them up in a
              redundant failover configuration, so that if one of them goes
              down, the other will automatically step in to ensure service to
              users isn't interrupted. You'll pay twice as much for colocation
              (because you'll use twice as much rack space), but the additional
              peace of mind is probably worth it.
            </p>

            <p>
              I haven't gone that far yet, but it is something I would
              definitely like to do. I <em>do</em> make off-site backups, but
              when my server is in Australia and I live in Spain, I would feel a
              whole lot more secure if I knew that I had a failover arrangement
              in place. I've done a bit of research on that topic, and will add
              another article to the
              <a href="https://typechecked.net/a/knowledge-base/">Knowledge Base</a>
              on that subject in the future.
            </p>

            <h4>Other hardware</h4>

            <p>
              When you start off as a hobbyist you presumably already have a
              computer. As you get bigger, you'll need to buy more hardware. For
              example, if you develop for more than one target operating system
              (for example, Jaguar, Panther and Tiger), you'll need additional
              partitions, drives or machines to do the testing. If you have a
              large customer base, you'll need a laptop so that you can stay in
              touch with your customers even when you're on the road.
            </p>

            <p>
              Even if you have only one machine, you'll want to make sure it's a
              good one. When you use your machine to make a living, its
              performance starts to matter. You may never play a game of Doom 3
              in your life, but if you find yourself waiting for your machine to
              catch up with your typing and mouse clicks, then you probably need
              a better machine. If it can't even keep up with your typing then
              just imagine how slow it will be at compiling and doing other
              things. Just ask me how I feel about working on a 1GHz PowerBook
              12" G4... By no means the slowest machine out there, but if I had
              a nickel for every time I have to wait for it to catch up with me
              in a day...
            </p>

            <p>
              And then of course there is the need to preserve data integrity.
              If you lose your family holiday snaps due to a hard drive failure
              then it's very sad; but if you lose all of your business data
              (your records, your source code) it could spell the end of your
              little enterprise. Unless you're prepared to see that data go
              bye-bye, then you'd be wise to invest in a UPS to protect against
              power failures and surges, some kind of RAID set-up (even if it is
              only twin mirrored drives using Panther's in-built software RAID),
              and a good backup mechanism (whether it be to external drives,
              burning to optical media, or tape).
            </p>

            <h4>Software</h4>

            <p>
              Luckily, the core development tools (Xcode Tools) are free, but
              there are a lot of non-free tools out there which will come in
              handy when developing your software, maintaining your website, and
              administering the business.
            </p>

            <p>
              Examples of commercial software that I've licensed for this
              website include
              <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> (for
              various sections of this website, including the one you're reading
              now), and <a href="http://ubbcentral.com/">UBB.threads</a> (for
              the forums). Each of
              those will set you back a couple hundred dollars.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fortunately, some things are free, like the
              <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>
              bug tracking and feature request database. The operating system on the server itself is free too (<a
                href="http://www.freebsd.org/"
                >FreeBSD</a
              >). Of course, if you want these great free packages to stay
              around then you really need to support them, for example by
              <a
                href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors.html"
                >buying a CD or DVD set</a
              >.
            </p>

            <p>
              Other tools which you may end up finding indispensable, all of
              them with hefty price tags include
              <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml"
                >BBEdit</a

            </p>

            <p>
              Other, less expensive software that I've purchased for work
              includes <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">ecto</a> (in fact, I'm
              typing in it right now),
              <a href="http://www.interarchy.com/main/">Interarchy</a>,
              <a href="http://babelcompany.com/impression/index.html"

                >Mail Scripts</a
              >, to name a few. [A couple of other products I've just started to
              trial, and which look like they'll soon become indispensable are
              <a href="http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html"

            </p>

            <h4>Domain names</h4>

            <p>
              At the beginning you may not even require a domain name. You might
              be happy with "homepage.mac.com/johnsmith/" as your website
              address. In order to market your software, you will eventually
              want your own domain name. There's really no limit to how far you
              can go with this. You may choose to buy a different domain for
              each product, and you can also opt to get not only the dot-com
              name, but the dot-net and dot-org as well.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my own case, I own quite a few domain names, but I direct them
              all to this one site, typechecked.net, because I want to build the
              Wincent brand.
            </p>

            <h4>SSL certificates</h4>

            <p>
              If you want to support SSL connections over HTTPS, then you'll
              need an SSL certificate as well.
            </p>

            <h4>Post office box, phone, premises</h4>

            <p>
              At some point you'll decide that you need an official physical
              presence in the world; not just a "cyber" presence. You can only
              use you're mother's mailbox for so long. Eventually you'll want
              your own post office box, phone line, and perhaps one day even
              leased office space. One of the beauties of Internet-based
              software business is that you <em>can</em> start off in your
              basement or bedroom if you need to, and the nature of the business
              is flexible and you can adapt it over time depending on how
              quickly (and even if) you grow.
            </p>

            <h4>Payment processing fees</h4>

            <p>
              <a
                href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/10/25/dev_osx.html"
                >This article</a
              >
              over at
              <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/">macdevcenter.com</a>
              reviews some of the payment processing services available to you.
              Personally I only have experience with
              <a href="http://www.kagi.com/">Kagi</a> and
              <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              PayPal's fees are lower, and so they enable you to set your price
              point lower, which in turn makes PayPal the most popular option
              with customers (even though many people have misgivings about
              PayPal). If someone donates you a dollar, you'll lose about half
              of it in fees, but if they pay you for a $5 product then you'll
              only lose 50 cents. You can withdraw the money into your bank
              account whenever you want for a $1 fee.
            </p>

            <p>
              You'll still want an alternative processing service, for those who
              don't like PayPal or can't use it, but the costs will be higher
              for both you and the customer. To use Kagi as an example; consider
              the product that sells for $5 via PayPal; if you were to sell it
              for $5 via Kagi you'd have only $2.50 after fees. Furthermore
              you'd have to wait a long time before you got access to the funds
              (for example, a payment made on 1 December wouldn't be mailed to
              you until 20 January, and if the cheque is being sent overseas
              then you will lose $10 for banking a foreign currency cheque, five
              to seven days for transit time, and 28 days for the funds to
              clear. What this means is that for the customer who paid you for
              the license on 1 December, you only actually get your hands on the
              funds three months later. This is effectively a cost to your
              business because not only do you miss out on earning three months'
              interest on that money, but you could well end up paying interest
              in the meantime because you are more likely to have to pay your
              bills using credit).
            </p>

            <p>
              Another additional cost with Kagi is that they charge VAT (Value
              Added Tax) to all customers living in the European Union, even if
              the company selling the software is located outside the EU and has
              a turnover that is below the threshold for VAT. I don't have the
              figures on me right now, but you can turn over something like
              $100,000 per year before you're officially required to collect
              VAT. So this means that a lot of customers are needlessly paying
              as much as 25% above the price that they should be paying when
              they use Kagi.
            </p>

            <p>
              The difference between Kagi and PayPal is most noticeable to the
              customer when the product is a low-priced one. For example,
              <a href="https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy/">Synergy</a>
              costs only 5&euro; when you purchase through PayPal, but $10 when
              you purchase through Kagi (plus VAT if you are unfortunate enough
              to be penalized for living in the EU). On a higher priced product,
              one that cost $25 or more, you could afford to equalize the prices
              across the board and absorb any differences so that the customer
              isn't affected.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another alternative is to get your own merchant bank account and
              hook yourself up with a payment gateway (for example, see
              <a href="http://authorize.net/">authorize.net</a> for a list of
              <a href="http://authorize.net/reseller/directory.php">resellers</a
              >).
              <a href="http://www.usms.com/">Some of those resellers</a> will
              open accounts for you even if you aren't in the USA.
            </p>

            <p>
              Having your own payment gateway means that you can bypass PayPal
              and Kagi with all of their fees and technical problems, but as
              always, there is a cost. There's no protection from chargebacks
              and you have to develop the server-side software (or purchase it)
              to talk to the gateway. This can be a costly exercise, but as you
              move along the scale from hobby to serious, it eventually becomes
              unavoidable. Would a company like Adobe or Microsoft use PayPal or
              Kagi to collect payments for their software? There's evidently a
              threshold somewhere, and one day you'll have to cross it.
            </p>

            <h4>Wages</h4>

            <p>
              Generally when you start of there'll be only one employee: you.
              But even when you are self-employed you still have to worry about
              wages. Of course, you'll have to pay bandwidth bills and the other
              costs that we've already discussed, but at the end of the day you
              are not in business if the activity you're engaging in doesn't end
              up putting money into your pocket. That money which, figuratively
              speaking, "goes into your pocket" is your wage. It goes without
              saying that unless you have a wage you won't be able to pay the
              rent or buy food to eat!
            </p>

            <p>
              You need to look at your time in terms of its dollar value. For
              example, in Australia, I can earn A$10 (US$7.50) per hour if I
              work "cash in hand" at a video store. If I work in a bookstore, I
              can earn almost A$17 an hour (before tax). These are both jobs
              that I've worked at in the past.
            </p>

            <p>
              When it comes to running your software business, you have to think
              in terms of the value of your time. So, I'll take that base figure
              of A$10 per hour. For every hour that I devote to software when I
              could have been working in the video store or the book store, I
              will have to find A$10 from somewhere to help me pay the rent, to
              recover the money that I didn't earn. In other words, if you
              expect to continue in business, you have to make sure that each
              hour you spend working on your business earns you $10. This is
              actually a pretty modest figure, compared to what a consultant, a
              doctor, a lawyer, or other professional would charge per hour. In
              fact, it's much less than a plumber or skilled tradesperson
              charges. So $10 is a realistic goal, but you are going to need
              every penny of it in order to meet all those costs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Of course, when you work on your own, you don't actually "pay
              yourself a wage" as such. There's no pay packet at the end of the
              week, the fortnight or the month. You take your income, pay your
              bills, and hope that there's some left over at the end. And along
              the way you use credit where necessary to ride you through the
              rough patches, and you try to accumulate a safety net when things
              are going well.
            </p>

            <h4>Tax</h4>

            <p>
              If you ever do get to the point where there is some money left
              over at the end of the month, you've officially got an income in
              the eyes of the taxation office. When you start off you might
              spend $5,000 in a year and only sell $1,000 of software. There's
              no tax to pay. Further along you might spend $5,000 but sell
              $10,000 in the year, and then you will indeed have to pay tax on
              the $5,000 that was left over, just as you would have to pay tax
              if you earned that money working as a sales assistant or a
              teacher.
            </p>

            <h4>Developer Program Membership</h4>

            <p>
              You'll want to join the
              <a href="https://connect.apple.com/">Apple Developer Connection</a
              >, or ADC. You can get a free online membership, but it really
              doesn't offer anything of much value. To get access to hardware
              discounts, software seeds, and regular mailings, you'll need to
              pay at least US$500 (annually) to get Select membership.
            </p>

            <p>
              It <em>is</em> a lot of money, but I do think it's worth it,
              especially if you can time it so that it coincides with a hardware
              purchase (the hardware discount could even be enough that the ADC
              membership ends up "paying for itself", relatively speaking).
            </p>

            <p>
              I started off as a free "Online" member and bought my first Select
              membership in November last year. Since then I've really
              appreciated the mailings, more than anything. It's also nice to
              receive the occasional copy of the operating system on official
              media. At the moment I only have one machine, so I am not about to
              go installing Tiger on it (I need my production machine to be
              totally stable); but if I did have another machine I think the
              seeds would be a valuable resource too.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next step up from Select membership is Premier membership,
              which includes even more benefits, but with a whopping price tag.
              Definitely not for the small shareware operator. An intermediate
              step would be to go to WWDC (the World Wide Developers
              Conference), but that too had a hefty price tag ($1,500) last time
              I checked, especially when you add in airfares and accommodation.
            </p>

            <h4>Office supplies</h4>

            <p>
              A small cost compared to the others, there's still no avoiding the
              need for blank media, paper, envelopes, stamps, and the other
              material you'll need in the day-to-day running of the business.
            </p>

            <h4>Advertising</h4>

            <p>
              Luckily, you can probably do without paid advertising for some
              time because the Internet is based on communities. There are lots
              of opportunities for free promotion and for "word of mouth"
              advertising. Generally, the more popular your software becomes,
              the more it will start to promote itself. Just make sure you've
              got your website in order when the visitors come!
            </p>

            <p>
              Of course, with increased attention comes increased competition.
              If you have a good idea expect it to be copied time and time again
              by people who can't come up with creative ideas of your own. The
              only remedy for this is to keep one step ahead as far as good
              ideas are concerned and hope that you have the time to implement
              them all! Legal warfare is probably not an option for the small
              operator!
            </p>

            <h4>Piracy</h4>

            <p>
              When I worked in the bookstore, shoplifting was a real problem,
              but I learnt a very valuable lesson from the owner of that store.
              Every day he knew that dozens of books, worth hundreds of dollars,
              were being ferreted illegally out of his store. He was an
              owner/operator, so it really was money from <em>his</em> pocket
              that was walking out the door.
            </p>

            <p>
              But what really impressed me was that he always kept his cool. Of
              course, if someone was detected shoplifting he apprehend them and
              called the police, if he could. But he was always cheery and he
              never became obsessed with the theme that every hour at least a
              few of his books were being stolen from the shop. He had every
              reason in the world to have high blood pressure, yet he didn't
              have it. And this was because he viewed theft as one of the costs
              of the business, just like electricity or rent. You wouldn't lose
              sleep because you have to pay for electricity, would you? I think
              that we can productively compare shoplifting with software piracy.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are lots of ways to look at piracy, depending on which side
              of the fence you're standing on: as a crime, as a fact of life, as
              a harmless pastime, as a game, and so forth. But as a business
              person, the only sensible way to look at piracy is
              <em>as a running cost</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Piracy is basically unavoidable, like paying for electricity. If
              you suffer a demonstrable 5 or 10% loss in sales because of
              piracy, then you're probably just like every other software
              company in the world. You can think about ways to minimize that
              loss (just like you can try to minimize your electricity bill),
              but you'll never escape it entirely.
            </p>

            <p>
              The problem is when that percentage gets out of control, as it has
              of late with my software. Over the last few months I've seen sharp
              drops in sales which correspond with periods when license codes
              are mass-distributed, or cracks start to circulate. You can match
              up the days on which leaks occurred with drop-offs in the sales;
              and you can watch the sales recover bit by bit when you blacklist
              license codes or block cracks. But once you've started to lose the
              war, the game is pretty much over. You'll have to resign yourself
              to about 30% loss in sales until you can completely re-engineer
              your protection.
            </p>

            <p>
              So the goal should be to have adequate piracy protection that
              keeps the damage done to a manageable level (like 5 or 10%) and
              not spiraling out of control (30% or more).
            </p>

            <h4>General costs</h4>

            <p>
              If you work on your own you won't have to pay other people's
              wages, but you will have to do all the work yourself! Imagine all
              that money you'll save when you don't have to employ a UNIX
              systems administrator to set-up and manage your web, mail and
              database servers; when you don't have to pay a web designer or
              graphic artist; when you don't pay an accountant; when you don't
              have to pay for customer support staff, and all the rest.
            </p>

            <p>
              Of course, the other side of that equation is that all of those
              jobs still have to be done (and more). And you are the person who
              will be doing them! And if you remember the point made above about
              the equivalency of time and money (your time being valued at $10
              an hour), you've got to remember that every hour you spend doing
              UNIX administration, every hour you spend doing accounting, and so
              forth, effectively costs you $10.
            </p>

            <p>
              You have to carefully evaluate where you spend your time, in terms
              of whether or not it will bring you the long term pay off. Ask
              yourself, if I spend an hour doing my tax return, will that time
              be well-spent, financially? (Of course, the answer is yes; if you
              don't do your tax return you might wind up getting fined or thrown
              in jail!). Ask yourself, if I spend an hour upgrading the mail
              server software, will that time be well-spent? And if I design new
              graphics for the web site? And if I spend a day learning how to
              set up a master and slave database replication setup?
            </p>

            <p>
              All of these questions have to be weighed up. It's one of the
              great things about the job: the variety; but you have to remember
              that ultimately every hour you spend has to be justified in the
              long term, and it has to have be financially viable, in the "big
              picture" sense, otherwise you won't be able to keep doing what you
              love to do (developing software). This very article is a good
              example of just one of those evaluations. Why have I spent a
              couple of hours ($20) writing an article for which no one is going
              to pay me? The answer is that I do it because I think it adds
              value to the site, helps to build a community here, and I think
              that in the long-run that having a community following at
              typechecked.net is in my best interests. And along the way I know that
              it's a good thing, because it might help other people, and helping
              other people is never bad.
            </p>

            <p>
              It can be a stressful thing at times, knowing that what you're
              doing has no immediate or tangible "pay off", and knowing that the
              rent will be due the next month and that above all else what the
              customers want is for you to work on <em>the software</em>. But
              it's a balancing act, because without all of the surrounding
              support work, the software wouldn't exist.
