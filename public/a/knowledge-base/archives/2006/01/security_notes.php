          same time I switched to <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a>

          not because I disliked
          <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> (in fact, I still love
          it) but because Red Hat was the "most supported" option offered by
          Rackspace, as far as I could tell. "Most supported" in the sense that
          the Rackspace staff seemed to have much more experience with Red Hat,
          and that would hopefully mean better tech support. Like I said, I
          didn't want any more hosting problems ever again.

        <p>
          I am a security freak. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is pretty
          secure out of the box. Their
          <a href="http://www.redhat.com/en_us/USA/rhn/rhndetails/update/"
            >automatic update system</a
          >
          allows servers to check once per day for packages with security fixes
          in them which are then automatically downloaded and installed,
          including any dependencies. One of the reasons RHEL costs money is
          that Red Hat stands behind this system and certifies it. Red Hat is
          basically saying, "We're not only going to fix individual security
          issues, but we'll take care of all the quality assurance and testing
          and ensure that the system as a whole continues to function no matter
          how many patches we apply". You're not just paying for "Linux with a
          bunch of open source packages thrown on top of it"; you're paying for
          a total "server solution" which if you can overlook the nauseating
          marketing language for a second translates to the expectation that the
          thing will work as a well-integrated whole, not just as the sum of a
          bunch of components that happen to work too. It's
          <em>only</em> because of this guarantee that I'm happy to place my
          trust in an automatic self-update system. (That and the fact that if
          something ever did go wrong, Rackspace's monitoring system would alert
          their staff straight away and they'd fix it even if I was asleep on
          the other side of the world or flying across the Pacific Ocean in a
          jumbo jet.)

        <h4>Plugging the FTP security and shell access holes</h4>

        <p>
          Being a security freak, I didn't want users on the machine uploading
          files via the insecure
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a>
          protocol. But in order to give them access via the superior and secure
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_file_transfer_protocol"
            >SFTP</a
          >
          protocol it appeared that I would have to give them shell access,
          unlike on my old server where it was easy to set up "virtual",
          non-shell accounts for the purposes of SFTP and email only. I wasn't
          about to give out shell access. To me, granting shell access on a
          system is like owning a jewellery store, leaving the store unattended
          and the door unlocked and letting people come in at will, resting on
          the assumption that the gold and diamonds will be safe because they're
          in locked glass display cabinets. As soon as you grant shell access
          you make yourself vulnerable to all of those security problems in
          which "local users" can "escalate their privileges" and gain root.
          Without local access none of these vulnerabilities are directly
          exploitable; the only attack vector available then is for users to try
          indirectly, uploading a PHP or CGI script which targets the
          vulnerability, and there are things we can do to make that more
          difficult (more on this later...).
        </p>

        <div id="a000178more">
          <div id="more">
            <p>
              So I found out about a need little shell called
              <a href="http://www.pizzashack.org/rssh/">rssh</a> by Derek
              Martin. You grant the users shell access, and set their shell to
              <tt>/usr/local/bin/rssh</tt>. But rssh is no normal shell; it will
              allow users to execute only one command,
              <tt>/usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server</tt> (you can also allow
              other commands &mdash; <tt>scp</tt>, <tt>cvs</tt>,
              <tt>rdist</tt> and <tt>rsync</tt> &mdash; if you want). So that's
              two security problems eliminated (insecure FTP and shell access
              for users). With rssh it will be very difficult for users to
              obtain escalated privileges. The server now becomes a jewellery
              store in which authorized people can visit but only with their
              hands tied behind their back.

            <h4>Total filesystem access</h4>

            <p>
              But the story doesn't end there. The problem with the
              <a href="http://www.openssh.org/">OpenSSH</a> implementation of
              SFTP is that it does not restrict users to their home directories.
              Once logged in, users can browse the entire file system, or at
              least the parts of which for which they have access. It
              <em>is</em> true that your file system permissions should be set
              in a way that prevents users from accessing stuff that they
              shouldn't have access to (like sensitive configuration files, logs
              which could reveal information that would be useful to an attacker
              looking for a weakness, or other people's email) but even so
              allowing free reign to explore the file system seems to be
              unnecessarily liberal and is simply asking for trouble.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I was on FreeBSD I addressed this by using the
              <a href="http://ssh.com/products/tectia/server/"
                >commercial SFTP server</a
              >
              from <a href="http://ssh.com/">ssh.com</a>, which allows you to
              "chroot" users to their directories upon logging in, thus
              preventing them from moving outside their home directories. When
              you "chroot" you are effectively "changing the root" of the file
              system. The user's home directory might be at
              <tt>/home/johnsmith/</tt> but when logged in via SFTP that folder
              becomes the new "root" of the file system (in other words, to the
              user, <tt>/home/johnsmith/</tt> looks to be <tt>/</tt> and he
              cannot <tt>cd</tt> "up" and out of that directory). For this
              reason this configuration is sometimes referred to as a "chroot
              jail"; the idea is that the user can't escape from it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now that I'm using RHEL I wanted to stick with the default OpenSSH
              install rather than resort to third-party tools; RHEL really
              manifests its strength, security and ease of maintenance when you
              keep things as close to the standard base installation as
              possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              The good news is that rssh allows you to set up a chroot jail and
              confine users to it. The bad news is that it can be tricky to set
              up. But once it is set up, your jewellery store is even more
              secure: it's now a jewellery store in which each customer has
              their own private booth and it's physically impossible for them to
              break out of it and look at other customers' booths.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why is setting up a chroot jail so hard? The main reason is that
              applications running inside the jail (in our case,
              <tt>/usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server</tt>) often dynamically link
              to library files and those files need to be inside the jail too
              otherwise the applications cannot access them and will fail to
              run. When I run the <tt>ldd</tt> tool on the
              <tt>sftp-server</tt> application it gives me a list of libraries
              that will need to be made available inside the jail:
            </p>

            <pre>
libresolv.so.2
libutil.so.1
libz.so.1
libnsl.so.1
libcrypto.so.4
libkrb5.so.3
libk5crypto.so.3
libcom_err.so.3
libc.so.6
libgssapi_krb5.so.2
libdl.so.2
ld-linux.so.2</pre
            >

            <p>
              I could copy these files to the jail but that would take up a lot
              of disk space if I had to do it for every single jail on the
              system. I could alternatively put all the users inside a single
              jail to save a bit of disk space; that would stop them from
              searching for sensitive configuration and log files but it still
              wouldn't prevent them from at worst seeing each other's data or at
              best finding out what other users have accounts on the system.
            </p>

            <p>
              The solution is to use "hard links" ("symbolic" links won't work
              across the jail boundary). Inside the jail you can set up a "hard
              link" reference to each of the necessary library files. The
              reference takes up effectively no space on the disk and to the
              jailed user it looks, feels and acts just like the original file.
              If the user were to delete the link, the original file would be
              untouched. On my system the use of hard links saves about 3.6MB of
              disk space per jail (compared with simply copying the required
              files).
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to hard-linking the library files listed by
              <tt>ldd</tt>, you also need to provide hard links to the
              <tt>sftp-server</tt> application itself and the
              <tt>rssh_chroot_helper</tt> executable (along with all the
              libraries to which the latter links). If either of these
              executables makes use of the dynamic linker you also should
              provide links to the dynamic linker support files,
              <tt>/etc/ld.so.cache</tt> and <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt>. Finally,
              you'll find that you'll need an appropriate
              <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> inside the jail itself in order for
              authentication to succeed.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are some technical hurdles to be overcome in doing all this:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                It's time consuming to manually set this all up; an automated
                method for setting up a chroot jail needs to be developed. That
                means we need to write a shell script.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prior to creating any links we need to ensure that the
                appropriate directories are in place; for example, if we need to
                link to libraries in <tt>/usr/lib/</tt> then each chroot jail
                must contain <tt>usr/lib/</tt> subdirectories.
              </li>
              <li>
                Most of the library files listed by <tt>ldd</tt> are actually
                symbolic links themselves, and if you try to create a hard link
                that points to a symbolic link you'll get a warning and it won't
                work properly.
              </li>
              <li>
                It can be cumbersome to find out in an automated way what the
                name of the real file (the target of the symbolic link) really
                is.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once you know the name of the target file and the name of the
                symbolic link you'll need to create a hard link to the real
                target file <em>and</em> a relative symbolic link to your newly
                created hard link.
              </li>
              <li>
                One of the goals of using the chroot jail is to prevent users
                from knowing what other user accounts are on the system: this
                means that instead of just hard-linking to the
                <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file you should create a new one for each
                user inside the user's jail which contains <em>only</em> the
                entry for that user.
              </li>
              <li>
                You should be able to run the script and then re-run it at a
                later date (for example, let's say you update your OpenSSH or
                rssh installations and want to "refresh" the jails).
              </li>
              <li>
                You need to set directory and permissions carefully so that a
                user logged in to a chroot jail can't inadvertently delete, move
                or rename any of these important files, break the jail and
                effectively lock themselves out.
              </li>
              <li>
                The script needs to run with root privileges to do all this, and
                giving that it is both automatic and making lots of changes to
                the file system it needs to implement lots of error checking,
                bail out on the first sign that things might be going wrong, and
                be used with extreme caution.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bonus points for automatically appending per-user configuration
                entries to the <tt>/usr/local/etc/rssh.conf</tt> file.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              The rssh distribution includes a script called
              <tt>mkchroot.sh</tt> which does a lot of this set-up for you if
              you're running the right kind of Red Hat distribution. I wanted to
              write my own script from scratch, however, because there are a few
              things I felt I could do better. For example:
              <tt>mkchroot.sh</tt> doesn't create hard links, it copies all of
              the libraries, taking up a lot of disk space unnecessarily; it
              also copies tools (for example <tt>scp</tt>) and libraries (such
              as name service resolution libraries) which I don't want or need
              inside my jails; finally, it copies the entire
              <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file rather than a subset of it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, I'm by no means a shell scripting expert. In fact, I feel
              very uncomfortable writing shell scripts, but I've managed to come
              up with something that seems to work. It meets all of the goals I
              listed above and addresses the issues I have with the
              <tt>mkchroot.sh</tt> script. It's main distinguishing features
              are: the use of variables to identify commandline executables
              (this is a habit of mine which ensures that the script will work
              regardless of what the PATH setting is, and it allows me to change
              all references to a tool in the script by changing a single
              variable); and the definition of a number of functions &mdash;
              <tt>die()</tt>, <tt>createdir()</tt>, <tt>checkbase()</tt> and
              <tt>link()</tt> &mdash; to handle commonly performed operations
              and make the code more readable
            </p>

            <p>
              Here's the first version of my script which has performed fine in
              my own testing on RHEL3. If you choose to use this script or any
              part of it you do so at your own risk:
            </p>

            <p>
              The only shortcoming of the per-user chroot jail approach is that
              logging via the syslog facility is broken. It is possible to
              modify your start-up scripts to start syslog with additional
              "FIFOs" inside each jail, but there are problems with this
              approach; as the rssh CHROOT documentation says:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              ... in order to log chroot activity, you need to create a socket
              for syslog to log to (i.e. /dev/log, see above) in each of the
              chroot jails. However, the number of sockets syslog can listen to
              is generally limited. On most Linux systems, that limit is a
              maximum of 20, though it can be changed by editing the source code
              to syslogd. On other platforms, this may not even be possible. So
              if you go with individual chroot jails, you either need to be
              satisfied without logging for most of your users, or recompile
              syslogd and manually configure it to open a socket in each of your
              users' jails. And while I haven't done it, I suspect creating
              large numbers of sockets for syslogd to listen to will make
              logging to syslog somewhat painful.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              For the time being, I'll just have to be "satisfied without
              logging", although the truth is that I am not sure exactly what
              kind of stuff would be logged by <tt>sftp-server</tt> and
              <tt>rssh</tt> anyway...
            </p>

            <h4>Hardening Apache CGI and PHP</h4>

            <p>
              So the combination of SFTP, rssh and per-user chroot provides
              quite a good degree of security. We now have a jewellery store in
              which customers can only enter with their hands tied behind their
              backs, they are confined to their own private booths, and they
              have no way of knowing what other customers have booths at the
              store.
            </p>

            <p>
              That leaves us with the "shared server" security problems which
              have long plagued <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>.
              These are not a security "hole" in the formal sense but rather a
              consequence of the fact that Apache generally runs as user
              "apache" (or "nobody" or "www") and that means that
              <em>everybody</em> with a virtual host on the server ends up
              running with same privileges. That means that a user can write a
              CGI or PHP script, and that script will be able to read/write any
              file for which the webserver has privileges. Malicious users could
              sniff for database passwords and other sensitive information. This
              is like providing all of our jewellery store customers with
              equally-capable remote control robots which can move around
              outside of their private booths.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are ways around this but they are generally not all that
              compatible with the idea of mass shared/virtual hosting. For
              example, you could run one Apache process for every user on the
              system but that's not viable for large numbers of virtual hosts.
              You could also try to set up a private virtual server for each
              user using software like
              <a href="http://www.xensource.com/">Xen</a> but again scalability
              is a problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I was on FreeBSD I used the
              <a
                href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/arch-handbook/jail.html"
                >inbuilt jail subsystem</a
              >
              (<a href="http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/papers/jail/jail.html"
                >see also</a
              >) which allowed me to create relatively lightweight virtual
              private servers. In theory no user could break out of his or her
              jail nor see or touch other users' data. But, still, there were
              limits to how many I could comfortably fit on a single host
              machine. Each one required its own IP address and considerable
              disk space. Furthermore, every time that I had to patch the host
              operating system I had to patch it inside each of the jailed
              systems as well. Even with automation it was a time consuming and
              complicated process.
            </p>

            <p>
              With the move to Rackspace I was moving to a system with a single
              IP address and with no OS-level support for anything like
              FreeBSD's jail solution. So I had to do the best I could to lock
              things down without resorting to virtualization.
            </p>

            <p>
              CGI scripts are fairly elegantly handled by the
              <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/suexec.html"
                >Apache's suEXEC support</a
              >. With suEXEC, when "johnsmith" uploads a CGI script to the
              server Apache will run that script as user "johnsmith", not as
              user "apache". Another user, "henrykrinkle", will find that his
              scripts run as user "henrykrinkle". When this is combined with
              appropriate file permissions, the is no way that "johnsmith" can
              use a CGI script to read or alter the files of "henrykrinkle" and
              vice versa.
            </p>

            <p>
              <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is not so easily handled. It
              has a thing called
              <a href="http://www.php.net/features.safe-mode">"Safe Mode"</a>
              which is designed to partially address the shared server security
              problem. I say partially because the PHP documentation itself
              admits that the solution is not ideal:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              It is architecturally incorrect to try to solve this problem at
              the PHP level, but since the alternatives at the web server and OS
              levels aren't very realistic, many people, especially ISP's, use
              safe mode for now.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              The problem is that PHP is generally used as an Apache module so
              by definition PHP scripts run with the same user, group and
              privileges as the webserver itself. You can try installing
              <a href="http://www.php.net/security.cgi-bin"
                >PHP as a CGI binary</a
              >
              but you may find that not all existing PHP software plays nicely
              with it, it may have security risks of its own, and in any case
              PHP-as-cgi is not a standard part of RHEL so you lose the benefit
              of any automatic updates provided by Red Hat.
            </p>

            <p>
              Safe Mode is pretty much your only option in this case. It won't
              make your scripts run with the user and group of the user that
              owns the scripts, but it will perform additional checks before
              executing code and opening files, it allows you to restrict access
              to certain parts of the file system (such as a user's home
              directory) and it allows you to disallow the use of certain
              functions. It is not perfect, impossible-to-circumvent security,
              but it is better than none at all.
            </p>

            <p>
              To turn on suEXEC and Safe Mode protection for "johnsmith" you'd
              add something like this to his
              <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/vhosts/examples.html"
                >VirtualHost</a
              >
              entry in your Apache configuration:
            </p>

            <pre>
SuexecUserGroup johnsmith johnsmith
php_admin_value safe_mode "1"
php_admin_value open_basedir "/home/johnsmith/public_html/"</pre
            >

            <p>
              One of the most annoying things about Safe Mode is that files
              created by PHP scripts will be owned by the Apache process itself
              and not by the user running the scripts. This can make it
              difficult for scripts to delete files which they themselves
              created. There is also a lot of PHP software out there that
              doesn't work properly with Safe Mode and in those cases you may
              have to turn off Safe Mode on a per-directory basis. If you do
              this, try to disable Safe Mode in the smallest possible region of
              the file system that will enable the software to work (in other
              words, turn it off in the sub-directory where the software is
              installed rather than turning it off for the user's entire home
              directory). You can also often leave the
              <tt>open_basedir</tt> directive in effect, at least providing some
              degree of protection from casual snooping.
            </p>

            <p>
              So to take our jewellery store analogy to its ultimate, contorted
              extreme, what we now have is a jewellery store in which persons
              who provide the appropriate identification are allowed to enter
              into their own private booths with their hands tied behind their
              backs, and with no way of knowing what other customers might have
              private booths of their own. Each customer has a remote control
              robot that could conceivably be used to snoop around outside their
              booth, but it's a disabled robot that's programmed to not move
              outside certain boundaries and is unlikely to be of much use to
              all but the most skillful and determined attacker. And if that's
              the kind of user you're giving accounts to perhaps you should
              think twice about it.
