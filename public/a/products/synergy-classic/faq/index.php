          <h4>
            <a name="growl" id="growl"></a>How do I make Synergy work with
            Growl?
          </h4>

          <p>
            To make Synergy work with <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>,
            you first need to
            <a href="http://growl.info/downloads.php">download</a> and
            <a href="http://growl.info/documentation/">install</a> Growl
            (version 0.6 or above). Once Growl is running, you stop and restart
            Synergy (if it is running). This causes Synergy to register itself
            with Growl, and from that point on Growl will show notifications
            whenever iTunes' track or status changes. You can control the
            appearance of these notifications by adjusting the Growl preferences
            (at the time of writing, "Bubble", "Smoke", "Music Video" and
            "Bezel" are the most useful display options). Screenshots of the
            different display options can be found on the
            <a href="../screenshots/">Synergy screenshots</a> page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Synergy transmits the same information to Growl that it would
            display in its own Floater (such as title, artist, album, duration
            and rating). If you turn any of these options off in the Synergy
            preferences, then Synergy will not include the deselected item in
            the notification that it sends to Growl.
          </p>

          <p>
            Synergy's Growl support requires Synergy version 1.7, iTunes 4.7 and
            Mac OS X 10.3 or later.
          </p>

          <h4>
            <a name="fullScreen" id="fullScreen"></a>How do I hide the floater
            so I can watch a DVD in full-screen mode?
          </h4>

          <p>
            Although some programs such as QuickTime Player correctly hide the
            Synergy floater when they run in full-screen mode, others (such as
            Apple's own DVD Player) draw <i>behind</i> the floater even when in
            full-screen mode. This is particularly noticeable when you have
            Synergy set to &quot;<a href="../preferences/general/"
              >Show floater always</a
            >&quot;. In order to watch a DVD in full-screen mode without the
            floater, you can press the
            <a href="../preferences/hot-keys/">hot key</a> for &quot;Show/hide
            floater&quot; to force the floater from the screen. You can also
            select &quot;Turn Floater off&quot; from the Synergy Global Menu.
            This functionality was introduced in Synergy 0.9.7.
          </p>

          <h4>
            <a name="buttonGraphics" id="buttonGraphics"></a>How can I make my
            own menu bar button graphics?
          </h4>

          <p>
            If you would like to create your own button graphics and submit them
            for inclusion in <a href="../buttons/">the gallery</a> you can do so
            by preparing the graphics according to the following guidelines and
            then submitting them to me via email ("win" at this domain).
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Create a folder based on the name of your button set, plus a
              "synergyButtons" extension. By using this extension, the folder
              can be double-clicked and Synergy will automatically display the
              button set;
            </li>
            <li>
              Button graphics should be in PNG format, with transparent
              backgrounds so that the menu bar can show through any unused area;
            </li>
            <li>
              Two buttons of equal width (for visual symmetry) should be created
              for the &quot;next track&quot; and &quot;previous track&quot;
              buttons; these files must be named &quot;nextImage.png&quot; and
              &quot;prevImage.png&quot; respectively;
            </li>
            <li>
              Four more buttons (all with the same width as each other) should
              be created and named &quot;stopImage.png&quot;,
              &quot;playImage.png&quot;, &quot;pauseImage.png&quot; and
              &quot;playPauseImage.png&quot; (this last graphic is used when
              communication between Synergy and iTunes is interrupted and hence
              Synergy does not know whether to display a pause or a play image);
            </li>
            <li>
              All button graphics should be 22 pixels high (the height of the
              Mac OS X menu bar);
            </li>
            <li>
              Button graphics should be saved in &quot;web ready&quot; format
              (without resource forks);
            </li>
            <li>
              You should ensure that all graphics have a resolution of 72 DPI x
              72 DPI (dots per inch) -- the Mac OS X default -- otherwise Cocoa
              will not display them as expected in Panther;
            </li>
            <li>
              You should download and edit
              <a href="../buttons/Info.plist">this plist file</a> so as to
              include your contact details. The plist file contains information
              about you and/or your company that you may wish to provide, and
              because it is in a machine readable format Synergy Advance will be
              able to display that information in the user interface. Do not
              change the name of the file (it should remain as "Info.plist");
            </li>
            <li>
              Place all the button graphics and the Info.plist file inside your
              synergyButtons folder.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Please note that a common error is incorporating blank space inside
            your button graphics in order to give them a "pleasing" spacing.
            This is what the "Button spacing" slider in the Synergy
            <a href="../preferences/menu-bar/">Menu Bar preferences</a> is for.
            By incorporating blank space inside your graphics, you make it
            impossible for users who prefer a tighter configuration to make full
            use of the slider. If you think your buttons look better spread out,
            then use the slider; do not build blank space into the button
            graphics themselves.
          </p>

          </h4>

          <p>
            Only applications that access Apple's private &quot;MenuExtra&quot;
            API can be moved in this way, and with the release of Mac OS X 10.2
            Apple removed the ability of third-party applications to access this
            undocumented API.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are applications on the market that hack their way around this
            restriction, but their techniques are not supported by Apple and
            there is no guarantee that they will continue to work in future
            versions of the OS.
          </p>

          <p>
            As such, Synergy elects not to make use of these methods, but
            instead uses the Apple-approved mechanism for appearing in the menu
            bar: the &quot;StatusBar&quot; API. This mechanism is officially
            supported by Apple. If and when Apple decides to allow StatusBar
            items to respond to Command-drag events, Synergy will be movable in
            this fashion.
          </p>

          <p>
            One benefit of using the StatusBar mechanism is that, unlike
            MenuExtras, StatusBar items do not crash when the SystemUIServer
            goes down (or is brought down by another MenuExtra). StatusBar items
            like Synergy cannot be crashed by, or cause to fail other items on
            the menu bar.

          <p>
            This feature will appear in a future version of Synergy. For the
            time being, Synergy instead provides an alternative means of finding
            out the name of the currently playing song without switching to
            iTunes. Whenever you hover your mouse over the Play/Pause button a
            tool-tip will appear showing the title, album and artist of the
            current song.
          </p>

          <p>
            Version 0.5 of Synergy also introduced the ability to display a
            semi-transparent notification window (called the
            &quot;floater&quot;) whenever a new song begins to play. Version
            0.9.3 introduced the ability to leave the floater on screen
            permanently, instead of fading out after a delay.

          </p>

          <p>
            When the floater is in &quot;Show always&quot; mode, you can still

          </h4>

          <p>
            By default, Synergy automatically checks once per day to see if a
            new version has been released. Your privacy is protected because no
            information is transmitted to the server in order to perform this
            check; Synergy merely asks the server what the latest version number
            is, and if the number is higher than the currently running version,
            a dialog is displayed.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is not yet a control in the user interface for this feature,
            but you can still control it by editing the Synergy preferences
            file. Make sure Synergy is not running when you edit the file. The
            file is at
            &quot;-/Library/Preferences/org.wincent.Synergy.plist&quot;. To
            modify the settings look for the following entry in the file:
          </p>

          <pre>
&lt;key&gt;Automatic Internet version checking interval&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;real&gt;86400&lt;/real&gt;</pre
          >

          <p>
            Here the number 86400 indicates that checking will occur once every
            86,400 seconds (in other words, once every day). If you set the
            number to 0 (zero) then checking will never occur; this is how you
            would disable the automatic version checking feature. The minimum
            value that you can use is 86400; lower values will be ignored and
            Synergy will check once per day.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you wish to check once per week you would use a value of 604800.
            If you wish to check once per month you would use a value of
            18396000. And if you wish to check once per year then you would use
            a value of 31536000.
          </p>

          <p>
            You must be careful when modifying the preferences file to change
            only the number and not any of the surrounding text. Doing so may
            result in a badly formed preferences file that Synergy cannot read.

              >legislation introduced by the EU on 1 July 2003</a

            new rules and automatically collects VAT on all transactions at the
            appropriate rate depending on the purchaser's country, and then
            remits it to the appropriate agency in that country. This is an

            but a feature of Synergy 1.5b and up when used in conjunction with
            iTunes 4.7 and above. When Synergy detects that iTunes 4.7 is
            installed on your system it switches to the
            <a href="../history/#1.5b">new communications engine</a>, which
            doesn't do any polling at all. In this circumstance the slider no
            longer has any meaning because Synergy doesn't poll but instead
            waits for notifications from iTunes.
          </p>

          <p>
            On systems running versions of iTunes prior to 4.7 the slider is
            unghosted and the old communications engine is used. iTunes 4.7 is a
            recommended upgrade for all Synergy users because of the massive
            performance improvements when using Synergy.

          <p>
            This is not a bug, but a consequence of a design decision. One of
            Synergy's design goals is to be minimise load on system resources,
            and so it reduces CPU usage by only querying the status of iTunes
            once every 3 seconds.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a result, if you have checked the box, &quot;Display controls

            <a href=".../preferences/menu-bar/">Menu bar settings tab</a> you
            may find that there is sometimes a slight delay between iTunes
            launching or quitting, and Synergy's menu bar controls changing in
            response.
          </p>

          <p>
            A design goal for later versions of Synergy is to improve the
            efficiency of communication between iTunes and Synergy so as to
            permit more frequent querying, most likely around once per second,
            and therefore greater responsiveness.

          <p>
            This rare issue can sometimes occur if you install a new version of
            Synergy simply by dragging it into your PreferencePanes folder and
            overwriting an older copy. The problem is caused due to a caching
            behaviour of the System Preferences application that means it fails
            to register the presence of a new version and hence the new help
            files.
          </p>

          <p>The solution is as follows:</p>

            <a name="hotkeysWorking" id="hotkeysWorking"></a>Why don't the Hot
            Keys work?
          </h4>

          <p>
            Hot Keys are based on hardware-dependent codes that vary from
            computer to computer. Although the default Hot Key settings that
            ship with Synergy will work on most Apple-branded equipment, there
            are some third-party keyboards and particular Apple models (such as
            certain iBooks) which will not respond properly to the default key
            codes.
          </p>

          <p>
            The solution in this case is to customise your Hot Keys on your
            machine using the <a href="../hot-keys/">Hot Keys tab</a> in the
            Synergy Preference Pane. The preference pane will capture the codes
            directly from your hardware and thus work with your keyboard even if
            it is a special or third-party model.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another situation in which Hot Keys may not work is if you choose a
            Hot Key combination that is already in use by another application.
            This is not recommended because the other application may
            &quot;capture&quot; those Hot Key presses and prevent them from ever
            reaching Synergy. Conversely, you may trigger an action in that
            application when you only intended to issue a directive to Synergy.
            As such it is recommended that you choose unique Hot Key
            combinations. (See also &quot;<a href="#functionKeysOnly"
              >Can I use just a function key as a Hot Key, and not have to use a

          </h4>

          <p>
            Due to a shortcoming of Mac OS X, Synergy versions up to 0.9.2 could
            cause iTunes to automatically respawn when trying to quit iTunes or
            log out. This would occur on average from 5 to 15% of the time.
          </p>

          <p>
            This problem is completely remedied in Synergy version 0.9.3 and
            higher. If you continue to see unwanted respawns after upgrading to
            version 0.9.3 or above, then the likely cause is another iTunes
            accessory running on your computer. (Such accessories might include

            isolate the accessory causing the problem and contact the author of

          <h4>
            <a name="shadow" id="shadow"></a>Why do the Synergy Menu Bar
            Controls cast a shadow?
          </h4>

          <p>
            If you see shadows underneath your Synergy Menu Bar Controls this is
            most likely caused because you are running Metallifizer/APE from
            Unsanity. To remedy the problem, add Synergy to your &quot;Excluded
            applications&quot; list in the Metallifizer/APE preferences. The
            file that must be excluded is located inside the Synergy.prefPane
            package at: Synergy.prefPane/Contents/Resources/Synergy.app

          <h4>
            <a name="playpause" id="playpause"></a>Why does the Synergy
            play/pause button change appearance?
          </h4>

          <p>
            Most of the time, the Synergy menu bar play/pause button will
            display either a &quot;play&quot; image (a right-pointing triangle)
            or a &quot;pause&quot; image (two vertical rectangles). At times,
            for example when dragging the iTunes window, the Synergy play/pause
            button may display a mixed &quot;play/pause&quot; image (one
            vertical rectangle and one right-pointing triangle). This occurs
            whenever the communications link between Synergy and iTunes is
            interrupted, and the combined &quot;play/pause&quot; image reflects
            the fact that the status of iTunes (playing or paused) is unknown to
            Synergy.
          </p>

          <p>
            One example of a situation in which this can occur is when the user
            drags the iTunes window around the screen, or runs an iTunes
            visualiser. Under these circumstances, because of the way it is
            programmed, iTunes does not respond to communication attempts made
            by other applications, such as Synergy. So in these cases, you might
            see the combined play/pause image; when communications are
            re-established and the state of iTunes is again known, the button
            will revert to the appropriate state.

            System Preferences even after dragging it to the trash?
          </h4>

          <p>
            This is caused by a bug in Apple's System Preferences application
            which causes stale information to remain in the cache. Instructions
            for getting around the bug appear on the
            <a href="../installing/">installation and removal page</a>.

          </h4>

          <p>
            It is not possible to set F14 and F15 for Hot Keys as Apple reserves
            them for controlling the brightness on their LCD displays. By adding
            a modifier to the Hot Key, such as &quot;Command&quot;, you may use
            those as Hot Keys, but you will not be able to use them for this
            purpose <i>without</i> a modifier unless Apple changes its
            implementation.

              Locate your installed copy of the Synergy.prefPane in the Finder.

              In the window that appears, open the &quot;Contents&quot; folder,
