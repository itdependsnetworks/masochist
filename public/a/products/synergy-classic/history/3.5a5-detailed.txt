    Restore Edit menu to Synergy Preferences application
    
    I was overly enthusiastic in removing this; it turns out that without it
    the keyboard shortcuts for Copy and Paste don't work, and that makes
    entering registration information unnecessarily painful.

    Don't rely on synthesized setter for mutable property
    
    A synthesized setter on a mutable property, combined with the copy
    attribute, will send a copy message to any object passed in to it, thus
    converting it into an immutable object.
    
    So in this case must provide a non-synthesized setter which correctly
    employs mutableCopy.

    Replace use of NSAppleScript in for refreshing playlists
    
    NSAppleScript appears to cause crashes in a GC environment, so dump it
    in favor of the Scripting Bridge.
