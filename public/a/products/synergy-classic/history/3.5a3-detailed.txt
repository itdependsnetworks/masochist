commit 994da25a7af1e5a412eb5212014e620ecf880b12
Author: Greg Hurrell <greg@hurrell.net>
Date:   Mon Jan 7 13:24:08 2008 +0100

    Pass NULL to executeAndReturnError:
    
    The only known crasher at the moment is happening NSAppleScript's
    executeAndReturnError: method.
    
    Unfortunately, I can't see anything at all in the calling environment
    that could explain the crash. The NSAppleScript instance is set up using
    a static NSString literal which by definition can never be garbage
    collected. I am beginning to fear that NSAppleScript can't be used at
    all in a garbage collected environment.
    
    As a defensive tactic I'm updating all invocations of the method to pass
    NULL for the error dictionary. This usage is not documented, but it does
    follow a pattern employed by many other Apple APIs and there are plenty
    of examples of code out there in the wild that do use this pattern.
    
    So basically this is a "try it and see" change to see if it eliminates
    the sporadic crashes. If it doesn't then more drastic measures will be
    required, most likely involving the replacement of NSAppleScript with
    something else (the scripting bridge, for example).

    Add README to distribution
    
    A README is probably necessary given the number of important changes in
    the 3.5 release (principally the change of format from System
    Preferences pane to standalone application, and the new minimum system
    version requirement).

    Add LSMinimumSystemVersion to Info.plist
    
    The installer used to advise the user if the system did match the
    minimum requirements; now that this is a standalone application we
    instead rely on the system to do so thanks to the LSMinimumSystemVersion
    key in the Info property list.

    Close the application when last window is closed
    
    This provides a nicer user experience. If there are unsaved changes the
    user will already have seen/dismissed the "Apply"/"Don't Apply" sheet,
    so don't resurrect the window and show the sheet again.

    Provide menu item for bringing preferences window on screen
    
    Useful for when user dismisses preferences window and later decides that
    he/she wants it back.
    
    An interesting case is when there are unapplied changes; if the user
    tries to close the window, clicks "Don't Apply", and then tries to quit
    the application then the window will come back on screen again and the
    sheet will be shown.
    
    In order to support this repeated showing of the preferences window had
    to use the setReleasedWhenClosed: method. Note that I may later decide
    to auto-quit the application when the last window is closed.

    Set up the initial strings and untranslated.strings files using
    UpdateXibs.sh. In so far as is possible, I have tried to use the old
    localization info extracted from a previous release. In many cases
    this applies cleanly to the new xibs, but there are many where it does
    not, and these will still need to be updated by hand; even in the cases
    where the old strings applied cleanly any custom geometry will have to
    be added back in by hand because this did not carry across.

    Reference top-level nib objects for GC and clean localizations
    
    Add top-level strong references to a couple more nibs to ensure that
    objects don't get inopportunely garbage-collected.
    
    I would have liked to propagate this same change to the other nibs using
    ibtool but unfortunately there are quite a few errors (class mismatches)
    reported that prevent this from proceeding; so somewhere in the long
    history of these nibs they have gotten far enough out of sync with the
    authoritative English versions to make them unusable with ibtool.
    
    So, for now I am temporarily removing the unsynchronizable nibs
    entirely; I will have to create new nibs (copies of the English nibs)
    and copy the strings across by hand from the older localizations that I
    have on file. This will be a lengthy and painful job, so it might be
    sometime before it gets completed.

    Update release procedure and development notes
    
    Lots has changed since these notes were originally written; there are
    still references to CVS in there, for example, and that was phased out a
    long time ago in favor of Subversion, then SVK and finally Git.
    
    So prune the irrelevant bits.
    
    This commit also includes a simple shell script for tagging releases in
    Git; seeing as each release should really be tagged in at least three
    repositories (Synergy itself, WOCommon and WOPublic), it's easier to do
    this with a single script.

    Add built-in uninstaller for global installs
    
    In 0b7051e I added an uninstaller for local installs. This commit does
    the same for global installs (which require root privileges to
    uninstall).

    Force strong references to top-level nib objects
    
    Set up some phoney outlets to the top-level objects in the nib so as to
    create strong references to them and thus avoid having them garbage
    collected.
    
    I am not entirely sure of all the cases in which this is required (I
    know that it is required for standalone controllers) so I have created
    outlets for all "real" (instantiated) top-level objects (at this stage
    that only means the controller and the MainMenu).

    Build-in uninstaller for old versions
    
    Now that we don't have an installer we still need a way to clean up old
    versions of the software, so build-in an uninstallation facility. This
    first implementation is for local (non-root) installs only. A subsequent
    commit will add global uninstall capability.

    Handle application and window closing
    
    Special handling for application and window closing if there are
    unsaved changes. To get this to actually work I also had to fix a bug in

    rather than the subclass as specified by the NSPrincipalClass key in the
    bundle info property list.

    Initial version of standalone preferences application
    
    Now the Synergy prefPane is no longer loaded by the System Preferences
    and is instead hosted by a standalone application. This commit is an
    initial version of the application which loads the prefPane bundle and
    displays the window in the center of the screen on launch.
    
    This change was made after a review of the Garbage Collection migration.
    Synergy's code is found in two places: inside the application itself and
    inside the preference pane (and the application is bundled inside the
    preference pane bundle). The application code has been converted to use
    Garbage Collection but the preference pane code could not be converted
    because the System Preferences application is compiled without GC
    support and the PreferencePanes framework against which the preference
    pane must link does not come in a GC-enabled version, at least as of
    Leopard.
    
    This is problematic because some of the Synergy code is shared between
    the app and the preference pane; it is therefore necessary for the
    common code to be written using a reference-counting style (which
    largely negates the benefit of moving to GC) or using conditional
    compilation to produce two variants of the same code (which is an
    error-prone process).
    
    So evaluating all this, it seems the best course of action is to host
    the preference pane in a standalone application. In order to do so I
    can no longer link against the PreferencePanes framework, so I've made
    a new class, WOPreferencePane, to stand in for NSPreferencePane, and
    a simple NSWindow subclass, WOPreferenceWindow, to load and display a
    single pane.
    
    An additional benefit of this move is that from now on Synergy will
    not require an installer because as a standalone application it can
    be installed anywhere.

    Remove WOSingleton class and other cruft
    
    Much the same as I did in WOCommon, remove the WOSingleton abstract
    class in favor of concrete per-class implementations. This is
    especially overdue in the case of Synergy as its WOSingleton was
    considerably less sophisticated than the version in WOCommon.
    
    There is now only one class which requires singleton functionality
    and it now has it thanks to fast double-checked locks with memory
    barriers.
    
    At the same time as removing WOSingleton, also removed some other
    cruft classes that had been lying arond for ages as part of an
    experimental refactoring which was abandoned.
