    Fix iTunes respawn bug
    
    This was inadvertantly introduced by 994da25a. In cleaning up a bad
    idiom (checking BOOL return of a message sent to a receiver that might
    be nil) I ended up changing the behaviour. The previous idiom was bad
    but it (accidentally) worked; the new behaviour avoided the undesirable
    idiom but changed teh behaviour.

    Update all localizable strings files
    
    This is possible now that the parse error in the Portuguese localization
    has been fixed; it was previously preventing normal updates from
    proceeding.

    Fix missing semicolon in Portuguese localizable strings file

    script.

    Append extra blank lines at end of output
    
    When emitting release notes for a project that is spread out across
    multiple repositories we may end up invoking the ReleaseNotes.sh script
    several time, successively appending more and more output to the
    generated notes.
    
    Add two extra line feeds to make this easier: one because "git log"
    doesn't seem to emit one, and another to provide visual separation
    between sections.

    Automatically append wildcard to tag prefix
    
    Make life slightly easier for callers by automatically appending the
    wildcard (asterisk) to the passed-in tag prefix, thus saving them from
    having to do it.
    
    This assumes a convention that tags will following a
    "product name-product version" naming pattern.

    Always direct error and diagnostic output to the stderr
    
    Without this it may be harder to diagnose script failures (for example,
    in the ReleaseNotes.sh script we normally redirect the output to a file;
    in that case any error messages wind up in the file rather than in the
    Xcode build window where we want to see them).

    Teach release notes script to take an optional prefix parameter
    
    With this parameter and the help of a convention we can now produce
    release notes for projects spread across multiple repositories.
    
    In the "main" project repository we just invoke the script as normal
    (without parameters) and it uses "git describe" to find the last tag,
    the previous tag, and emit the differences between them.
    
    In the secondary repositories we pass a "tag prefix" which we use to
    locate the tags corresponding to the release of the "main" project; in
    other words this depends on a convention in which we create tags in
    the secondary repositories which have a unique prefix which identifies
    the main project.
