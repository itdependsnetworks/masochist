    Show warning about running on Leopard
    
    Now that I've confirmed that this is an Apple bug, that they know about
    it, and that they intend to fix it, advise the user, seeing as it is
    such a big deal.

commit 68172bf3c5783841bc36d333971dc48ea9fb7bac

    Fix cover art bug #668
    
    The machines affected by the bug are seeing AppleScript errors like this:
    
      NSAppleScriptErrorBriefMessage = Can't make "7.6.2" into type integer.
      NSAppleScriptErrorMessage = Can't make "7.6.2" into type integer.
      NSAppleScriptErrorNumber = -1700
      NSAppleScriptErrorRange = NSRange: {0, 0}
    
    So it looks like a Info.plist issue. The version number is an integer
    for me on my Spanish system, but I suspect for others that it is a
    string. This is why I couldn't reproduce the bug.
    
    The version check is almost definitely not needed anymore, so drop it.

    Add diagnostic logging to cover art retrieval code

    Revert "Optionally delay querying for cover art"
    
    Deployed to customers who were experiencing the bug and unfortunately it
    doesn't work. Was worth a try anyway.
    
    This reverts commit 500ea5a99d5cf08f2ba6603814a4ca72a6b744fc.

    Optionally delay querying for cover art to workaround iTunes 7.6.1/7.6.2 bug
