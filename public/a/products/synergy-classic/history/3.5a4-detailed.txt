    Translate Spanish text in Synergy Preferences nib into English
    
    Leopard's Interface Builder has a new behaviour: when running on a
    non-English system new nibs are created in the current language rather
    than English. This true even when the development language is set to
    English and it's a deviation from the established behaviour in Tiger
    (and Panther, and Jaguar).
    
    As a result some of the menu items in the 3.5a3 release were in Spanish
    when they should have been in English. This commit translates them into
    English.
