          <h3>Synergy Advance license agreement</h3>

          <h4>Introduction</h4>

          <p>
            In order to install or use Synergy Advance you must read and agree
            to this license agreement in its entirety. This is a legal agreement
            between you, the end user, and Wincent, the developer of the
            software.
          </p>

          <p>
            Be sure to read and understand all of the rights and restrictions
            described in this agreement before using or installing the software.
            By using or installing this software you agree to be bound by the
            terms of this agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this
            agreement you must delete all copies of the software in your
            possession.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout this agreement "the software" is used to refer to the
            Synergy Advance distribution disk image, all files contained within
            it, and any copies of these files which you make under the terms of
            this agreement. Redistribution of the software in any form without
            permission is disallowed. Rather than redistributing the software
            independently please direct others to the official website (<a
              href="https://typechecked.net/"
              >https://typechecked.net/</a
            >) to download the product.
          </p>

          <h4>Ownership</h4>

          <p>
            The license gives you limited rights to install or use the software.
            Although you may own the media on which the software is stored you
            do not become the owner of the software. The software is licensed
            and not sold. Wincent retains the title to the software and all
            copies thereof. Other than the rights specifically granted to you in
            this agreement all rights are reserved by Wincent.
          </p>

          <h4>Demonstration</h4>

          <p>
            You may install and use the software on a trial basis for a period
            of seven days for the purposes of making a decision whether to
            purchase a license. If at the end of that period you do not wish to
            purchase a license then you must destroy all copies of the software
            in your possession. You may later at your discretion download,
            install and trial a later version of the software but you are not
            allowed additional trial periods for the same version. If you
            purchase a license then you become a registered user. Software
            running in demonstration mode behaves identically to when it is
            running in unrestricted mode with the exception that periodic
            reminder messages are shown and the software will not run for more
            than seven days.
          </p>

          <h4>Registration and activation</h4>

          <p>
            On purchasing a license you will receive a license code via email
            that can be used to register and activate the software. In the
            registration process you enter your license email address and
            license code in the software's user interface. The activation
            process then follows and the software connects to the Wincent server
            for the purposes of validating the license. None of your personal
            information is transmitted to the server in this process. Once the
            process is complete the software leaves demonstration mode and
            operates in unrestricted mode. More information about the activation
            process and how your privacy is protected is available on the
            website:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://typechecked.net/a/support/activation/"
                >https://typechecked.net/a/support/activation/</a

              >
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Upgrades</h4>

          <p>
            Registered users are entitled to free upgrades within each major
            version series of the product. A change in the major version series
            is indicated by an increment in the numeral to the left of the
            leftmost decimal point in the version number. For example, versions
            1.0, 1.1, 1.2 (and minor revisions such as 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and so
            forth all belong to the same major version series, but version 2.0
            and subsequent versions are a new series. Wincent may elect to offer
            discounted upgrade licenses for people who wish to upgrade from one
            major version series to another.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the user upgrades from an earlier version of the software, the
            newer version is provided on a license exchange basis. You agree by
            your installation or use of this version of the software to
            voluntarily terminate your earlier license and enter into a new
            license agreement based on this version of the license agreement
            document. You also agree that you will not continue to use an
            earlier version of the software nor transfer it to another
            individual or organisation.
          </p>

          <h4>Transfers</h4>

          <p>
            Licenses are non-transferrable. You may not rent, lease, sell, lend,
            sublicense or give the software to another person or organization.
            If you wish to transfer or dispose of any media in your possession
            on which the software is installed to a third-party then you must
            first destroy all copies of the software installed on that media.
            For example, if you sell a computer on which the software is
            installed then you must first destroy all copies of the software
            present on the computer; selling the computer does not permit you to
            sell, give away or transfer in any other way the license. If you
            wish to distribute media containing the software (for example, for
            use on a magazine cover disc) then you must obtain permission from
            Wincent first. If you wish to purchase a license as a gift for
            another person then you should contact Wincent; Wincent will
            generate a license for the recipient of the gift and the recipient
            (not the purchaser) becomes the licensee and registered user.
          </p>

          <h4>Multiple users</h4>

          <p>
            Licenses by default are single-user licenses. This means that a
            single user who licenses the software may install and use it on one
            and only one machine. If you wish to install the software on
            multiple machines then you must purchase multiple licenses. For
            example, if you have one laptop and one desktop machine and wish to
            install the software on both then you must purchase two licenses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mac OS X is a multi-user operating system and it is possible that
            multiple-users on the same computer may wish to use the software.
            Each user on the system that wishes to use the software must hold a
            valid license.
          </p>

          <p>
            Multiple user (or "multi-user") licenses also exist. These allow you
            to purchase one license valid for multiple users at a reduced price
            instead of purchasing multiple single-user license. For example, to
            license and install the software on five machines you may purchase
            five single-user licenses or one five-user license. Similarly if you
            install the software on a single machine where there are five users
            and each user intends to use the software then you will require
            either five single-user licenses or one five-user license.
          </p>

          <h4>Confidentiality</h4>

          <p>
            When you purchase a license you are issued with a license notice
            containing a license code which can be used to register the
            software. It is your responsibility to keep this notice and the
            information contained within it in a safe place and not to share it
            with any third-party, with the exception that you may share the
            information with your co-licensees in the specific case of a
            multi-user license.
          </p>

          <h4>Refunds</h4>

          <p>
            All sales are final and no refunds shall apply. It is recommended
            that you thoroughly evaluate the software in demonstration mode
            prior to purchasing a license.
          </p>

          <h4>Restrictions</h4>

          <p>
            You may not modify the software nor create derivative works based on
            the software.
          </p>

          <h4>Termination</h4>

          <p>
            This license is effective until terminated. You may terminate this
            license at any time by destroying all copies of the software and
            related files in your possession. This license will terminate
            immediately without notice if you fail to comply with any of the
            terms of the license. Upon termination you must destroy all copies
            of the software and related files in your possession. This license
            may also be terminated when you agree to a superseding license
            agreement offered by the licensor or accompanying an updated version
            of the software.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upon termination of the license you forfeit your entitlement to use
            or install the software. Termination does not affect the disclaimer
            of warranties, limitation of liability, or copyright provisions
            outlined below.
          </p>

          <h4>Third-parties</h4>

          <p>
            Given that the software interacts with products and services
            provided by third parties (such as Apple's iTunes, Amazon's Web
            Services and Growl there are no guarantees that the software will
            continue to function with future versions of those products and
            services although a best effort will be made to ensure that the
            software remains compatible.
          </p>

          <h4>Disclaimer</h4>

          <p>
            Wincent provides the software "as is" and no warranty of any kind
            applies. All other warranties are disclaimed whether they be
            express, implied or statutory, including but not limited to any (if
            any) implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness
            for any purpose or lack of viruses. There is no warranty or
            condition of title or of non-infringement. You use this software
            entirely at your own risk.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws in no event will
            Wincent be liable for any consequential, incidental, direct,
            indirect, special, punitive or other damages whatsoever (including
            but not limited to damages for any injury to person or property,
            damages for loss of profits, business interruption, loss of
            information, loss of privacy, negligence, and for any pecuniary or
            other loss) arising out of or in any way related to the use of,
            installation of, or inability to use or install the software. This
            exclusion of damages applies irrespective of whether those damages
            be based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or
            otherwise, even if Wincent has been advised of the possibility of
            such damages. This exclusion will be effective under all
            circumstances.
          </p>

          <p>
            To the full extent allowed by law, you hereby release Wincent from
            any and all liability arising from or related to all claims
            concerning the software.
