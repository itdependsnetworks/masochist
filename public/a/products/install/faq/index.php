          <h4>
            <a id="per-developer" name="per-developer"></a>Is the license fee
            per-product or per-developer? In other words, can I purchase one
            Install license and then use the product to deploy all of my
            company's software (multiple products)?
          </h4>

          <p>
            The license fee is &quot;per-vendor&quot;. If your company sells 20
            different Mac OS X software products, you can purchase a single
            Install license and you will be granted the right to use Install to
            deploy as many of those products as you wish.
          </p>

          <p>
            The definition of &quot;the vendor&quot; here will vary from
            customer to customer. If you are a lone developer working
            independently then you are the vendor. If your company purchases an
            install license, entering into the license agreement in the name of
            the company, then the company itself (and not you) is considered to
            be the licensee and therefore &quot;the vendor&quot;. When used with
            opensource projects then the collective that works on the project is
            considered to be &quot;the vendor&quot;.
          </p>

          <p>
            Licenses are not transferrable, so if you enter into a license
            agreement as an individual developer and then later move to another
            company, then you may not transfer your license to the new company
            and use Install to deploy that company's products under the terms of
            your previous license. Similarly, if an open source project acquires
            an Install license and the project later forks then the forked
            project would need to obtain its own Install license (because
            &quot;the vendor&quot; would be different); in order to avoid
            acquiring another license you would need to demonstrate that the
            vendor was effectively unchanged (in other words, that the project
            has the same development team and affiliated organization).

            <a id="freeware" name="freeware"></a>What is the definition of
            "freeware" and "open source" for the purposes of the special
            binary-only license?
          </h4>

          <p>
            In order to qualify for the discounted binary-only license, the
            software to be deployed must be either "freeware" or "open source".
            Software is considered to be freeware if it is available
            <em>free of charge</em>, and it has full,
            <em>unchanged functionality</em> regardless of whether payment is
            made. Most software that is labelled as "shareware", "nagware",
            "donationware" or "commercial" does not satisfy this requirement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Software which displays a reminder dialog asking for payments, even
            if it claims to be "free", is not considered to be freeware for the
            purposes of licensing Install, because the reminder dialog qualifies
            as <em>changed functionality</em> (those who donate don't see the
            dialog, those who don't donate do). If you are in any doubt about
            whether your software would qualify, please
            <a href="https://wincent.com/a/contact/">contact Wincent</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Software is considered to be "open source" if it is licensed under
            one of the approved licenses, the GNU GPL, GNU LGPL or the BSD
            license.

          <p>
            You may not strip any copyright notices from Install, regardless of
            the type of license that you enter into. The Install software
            itself, both in binary and source code form, is Copyright &copy; by
            Wincent Colaiuta, 2003-2004, All rights reserved. You retain the
            authorship of and copyright to any permitted modifications that you
            make to Install (exactly what modifications are permitted varies in
            each license, so please consult the full license text for details).
          </p>

          <p>What this means in practical terms is that:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              you may rename the Install application bundle itself (for example,
              you may wish to rename it from &quot;Install.app&quot; to
              &quot;Install Our Product Name.app&quot;);
            </li>
            <li>
              if you choose to rename the bundle you are not obliged to maintain
              the word &quot;Install&quot; in the title;
            </li>
            <li>
              you may add your own Copyright attribution to the
              CFBundleGetInfoString and NSHumanReadableCopyright fields in the
              Install InfoPlist.strings file (or files, depending on whether
              localized variants exist), but you may not remove or edit the
              existing Copyright attributions to Wincent Colaiuta in those
              fields (for example, you may wish to add your own Copyright to the
              original string, &quot;Install version 1.1, Copyright 2003-2004
              Wincent Colaiuta.&quot;, so that it reads, &quot;Install version
              1.1, Copyright 2003-2004 Wincent Colaiuta. Our Product Name
              version 2.0, Copyright 2004 Our Company.&quot;; any such changes
              will be reflected in the version and copyright information shown
              about the installer in the Finder and/or in the &quot;About
              Install&quot; window);
            </li>
            <li>
              you may not change the CFBundleName or the
              CFBundleShortVersionString fields in the InfoPlist.strings file,
              nor may you alter or remove the CFBundleSignature field in the
              Info.plist file;
            </li>
            <li>
              you may replace the Install icon file with a custom icon of your
              own;
            </li>
            <li>
              you may not edit the Install MainMenu.nib file or otherwise make
              alterations which have the effect of disabling or removing the
              &quot;Install website...&quot; Menu Item in the Install Menu;
            </li>
            <li>
              you may edit, and optionally convert to RTFD format, the
              Credits.rtf file that is used to construct the &quot;About
              Install&quot; window when the corresponding Menu Item is selected;
              but you must preserve the text in that file which attributes
              &quot;Installer engineering and design&quot; to &quot;Wincent
              Colaiuta&quot;. You may not remove the file unless you replace it
              with an equivalent RTFD file containing the same attribution. You
              may add additional lines to the file which attribute authorship
              for your own products to the corresponding authors, and if you
              have made modifications to Install as permitted by your particular
              license then you may add a line such as &quot;Installer
              modifications&quot; or &quot;Installer customization&quot;
              attributing authorship of the modifications to, for example,
              &quot;Our Company&quot;;
            </li>
            <li>
              you are not required to provide an attribution to Wincent in your
              product documentation, supporting materials or website, although
              any such reference you might make to Wincent and to the Install
              website (&lt;<a href="http://install.wincent.com/"
                >http://install.wincent.com/</a
              >&gt;) would be appreciated;
            </li>
            <li>
              You may not modify nor reverse engineer the binary data of the
              Installer executable itself.

          <p>
            If after reading the
            <a href="https://wincent.com/a/products/install/"
              >feature listing on the Install website</a
            >, <a href="../download/">looking at the sample applications</a> and
            looking at the <a href="../download/">Install manual</a> (which may
            further clarify the capabilities of the software for you), you are
            not sure whether Install has a feature or characteristic that you
            require, you can
            <a href="https://wincent.com/a/contact/">contact Wincent</a> to
            request a preview, binary-only copy of Install.
          </p>

          <p>
            If it turns out that Install does not have a function or feature
            that you require you can either purchase a
            <a href="../licensing/binary-plus-framework-license/"
              >binary+framework</a
            >
            or
            <a href="../licensing/full-source-license/">full-source license</a>
            as appropriate to enable you to implement the feature yourself, or
            you can make a request that Wincent add the feature to a future
            version of the product. I am extremely receptive to feedback and am
            always looking for ways that the software could be improved.

          <h4>
            <a id="full-source" name="full-source"></a>Why is the full-source
            license so expensive?
          </h4>

          <p>
            When you license a binary-only version of Install you are licensing
            a powerful deployment solution with a host of functionality and
            flexibility designed to make software installtion, updating and
            removal a breeze.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you purchase a binary+framework license, you receive, in
            addition to the above, limited access to Wincent intellectual
            property in a human-readable format above and beyond that which you
            could access in a binary-only context.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you purchase a full-source license, this limited access to
            Wincent intellectual property is greatly extended. The full-source
            license is expensive, and so is the binary+framework license (albeit
            to a lesser extent) because I consider this to be the value of
            access to that intellectual property.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the majority of developers, the power and flexibility of the
            binary-only solution will be enough to meet their deployment needs,
            and they can benefit at a relatively low price from the hundreds of
            hours of Wincent development effort that have gone into developing,
            enhancing and refining Install.
