            will be void. It is expressly agreed that Wincent and You are acting
            as independent contractors. These terms and conditions constitute
            the entire agreement between Wincent and You with respect to the
            subject matter hereof. These terms and conditions wil prevail
            notwithstanding any different, conflicting or additional terms and
            conditions that may appear on any other agreement between Wincent
            and You. Deviations from these terms and conditions are not valid
            unless agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of
            Wincent.
