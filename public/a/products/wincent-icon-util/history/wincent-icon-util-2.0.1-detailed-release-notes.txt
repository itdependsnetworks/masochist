    Bump version number for 2.0.1 release
    
    The 2.0 release itself was never actually published due to a glitch in
    the buildtools which prevent release notes from being produced for the
    very first release.

buildtools: Changes from wincent-icon-util-2.0 to wincent-icon-util-2.0.1:

commit 7d4e12254d339cce521486f482a02dc447a43b12
Author: Greg Hurrell <greg@hurrell.net>

    ReleaseNotes.sh: handle first release
    
    Our "git describe HEAD^" call fails for the first tagged release because
    there are no prior tags.
    
    Catch the error and just use the first root commit instead.
    
    This is not the only place where we use "git describe", but it is the
    most likely place where problems will crop up in practice (because
    usually there is at least _one_ annotated tag in the repo if we are
    running this script).
