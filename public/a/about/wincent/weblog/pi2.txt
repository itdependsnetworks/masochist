Way late on noticing your post (<http://www.private-intellectual.de/?p=602>)
but there is one thing you are mistaken about:

> There is another aspect to his criticism - which, in some ways, is
> a fair one if misguided - it isn't exactly his own. Rather, Wincent
> takes his comments - slightly re-written - from someone calling

If you look at the publication dates of the two articles you'll see
that my piece is an original work published *before* his:

8:29 AM: <https://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/06/wordpress_flaw.php>

4:45 PM: <http://fukamachi.org/wp/2007/06/21/yet-another-wordpress-exploit/>

We both wrote about it independently, no need for attribution. When I
saw his post I went back and added the link to it. So you need to
read and interpret both as independent pieces of work written in
isolation from each other because that's exactly what they are.

A couple of other differences of opinion:

> Reading the article is interesting, especially when you note that

* I actually do have real experience with WordPress -- I thought this
would be obvious from reading the article, but perhaps it wasn't. I
think that the key point is that I am an *ex*-WordPress user and
precisely because I got sick of the security issues.

* I note that comments are closed on your article too: my reasons for
not having comments are elaborated here: <https://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/06/comments_on_web.php>

I didn't turn off comments for security reasons; but having made that
decision, the added security of not having them turned on is a bonus
(ie. you site essentially becomes static). The dialog need not be in
a bunch of comments underneath my article; it can be "out there" on
the web; the proof is in the quality of the pudding: note how you
wrote an extended, reasoned argument that you never would have penned
if I had allowed comments on my weblog.

Cheers,
Wincent
