        Just found this page, and the interesting thing about it is how many
        hits per day you can expect to be able to serve with your new Rails app,
        depending on your hosting plan. I know it's only one data...

        When I first got on the Internet I used to want to know about email as
        soon as it was sent to me. I always set the checking interval to the

        In general I never throw out any mail, apart from spam that is. I have
        personal mails dating back as far as 1996; prior to that I only had

        among software developers. Take 1 The first is simply, don't worry about

        Without a doubt I have a love-hate relationship with AppKit and
        Foundation. Basically it boils down to loving working with Foundation
        and hating working with AppKit. They're both amazing frameworks, but
