                about this... have been very busy with work of late and so
                haven't really been keeping up to date with the news. While I
                would certainly love one of these machines, I'll probably be
                sticking with the trusty old first-gen Intel iMac for a while
                yet.

                (wincent.com, 513d102)
              </h4>
              <p>
                When showing all items marked with a single tag (ie. the
                &quot;show&quot; action of the tags controller) or all items
                matching multiple tags (ie. the &quot;search&quot; action) we
                unfortunately had an n+1 SELECT problem because we had to
                inspect each Taggable instance to see if the user had access
                permissions to it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now we reduce the number of queries by grabbing all Taggables
                for a given taggable type in one hit. In other words, given 3
                matching Articles and 10 matching Posts, we now do 2 queries
                during access checking rather than 13; and when we display the
                Taggables in the view there are no additional queries because
                the Taggables have already been fetched.

          <h3 id="a004233">Final server migration this week</h3>

          <p>
            I've been working on moving to the new server for
            <a
              href="https://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2008/02/server_migratio.php"
              >nearly a month now</a
            >, a process which has been quite slow because all the data has to
            be exported from a number of &quot;legacy&quot; applications and
            imported into a brand new custom Rails application written
            especially for this site. It's slow going because it's the first
            time I've ever deployed a Rails application and I've had
            <em>a lot</em> to learn... but now I know a fair bit about nginx,
            capistrano, mongrel, monit, and of course Rails itself. The server
            too is totally different, with a different operating system, so it's
            all been quite time-consuming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, the crunch time is now coming and the <em>real</em> server
            move is about to happen this week (at the end of the March the old
            server will go offline forever, so the move has to happen this week,
            ready or not). So this will most likely be my last post ever to this
            weblog.
          </p>
          <p>
            The forums are already in read-only mode, and I'm about to shut down
            the bug tracker too shortly so that I can do the final export of all
            the records and move them into the database on the new server. If
            you had an account on the old server you'll automatically have one
            on the new server too, although you will need to reset your password
            (I couldn't transfer across any passwords because none of them were
            stored in plain text, and rightly so of course).
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point during this week email might temporarily go down,
            hopefully only for about an hour (delivery failures should be
            temporary), and the wincent.com domain itself will go down at
            roughly the same time too. When it comes back up we'll be running on
            the new server. If you make a purchase during that time you might
            have to wait an hour or two for your license information, but we'll
            soon be back to immediate automated delivery.

            from Rackspace to INetU is currently underway. My aim is do this

            like this it makes sense to have an offsite feed.

          <h3 id="a004167">Microphone prices</h3>

          <p>
            I'm currently looking at getting a better microphone to do
            screencasts. The one I'm most interested in goes for between $84 and
            $100 in the US (57€ to 68€). Purchased locally here in Spain the mic
            goes for upwards of 130€.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, most of the retailers in the US don't want to ship
            outside of the US. I found one who would: they quoted me over $160
            shipping, plus $50 wire transfer fee (they don't accept foreign
            credit cards) and the cost of the mic on top of that for a
            <em>grand</em> total of $294. Ridiculous. That's 200€. Needless to
            say I'll be holding off until I find a better option.
          </p>
          <p>
            My past experiences ordering computer components from the US have
            always been excellent, but it seems that things are different in the
            audio realm.

          <h3 id="a004101">The joy of deleting code</h3>

          <p>
            Things have been quiet here of late because I've been feverishly
            trying to get things ready in order for the server move coming up at
            the end of this month. It's a big move because it's not just moving
            the box from one place to another; I'm changing data centers,
            hosting companies, operating systems, and application software all
            at once, and there is a <em>lot</em> of work to be done.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the things I'll be doing is replacing the teetering stack of
            disparate applications that I'm currently running (a mix of
            applications — Movable Type, UBB.threads, Mailman, Bugzilla,
            MediaWiki and a number of custom scripts — written in a mix of
            languages — Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby) with a single unified
            application, a custom job written in Ruby and built on Rails.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm taking the opportunity to greatly simplify things in the
            &quot;Web 2.0&quot; spirit (ugh, how I hate that term; but I've
            started to use it because it's lost some of its ridiculous hype feel
            and has now come to mean a set of widely understood
            characteristics). And it's actually quite a liberating experience.
            Each chunk of code that I delete makes me feel lighter, freer.

          <h3 id="a003874">Ragel wins! Fatality!</h3>

          <p>
            One of my projects is a
            fast wikitext-to-HTML translator. It's a
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby">Ruby</a> extension
            written in <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/C">C</a> with
            speed being one of its top design goals (robustness, predictability
            and security being the others). I'm working on this because the
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails">Rails</a> rewrite
            of this site will use
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/wikitext%20markup"
              >wikitext markup</a
            >
            for basically everything. Rails has a bad reputation for being slow
            and resource hungry, and that's why one of my primary objectives is
            speed; I don't want my wikitext parser being a bottleneck.
          </p>
          <p>
            The translator itself consists of a
            hand-coded parser written in C
            paired with a scanner/tokenizer/lexer generated from a
            grammar specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Up until now the scanner used a
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/ANTLR">ANTLR</a
            >-generated lexer using the &quot;C target&quot; (although ANTLR
            itself is written in Java, it can target multiple languages,
            including C). The C target is the current speed king among ANTLR
            targets and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. It
            too is engineered with speed in mind and is quite frugal with
            resources (for example, when emitting tokens it maintains pointers
            into the input stream rather than making a copy of the substring for
            each token).
          </p>
          <p>
            And the results were quite snappy. But for some time I've had the
            sneaking suspicion that a
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ragel">Ragel</a
            >-generated scanner would be faster. I suspected this even though
            ANTLR uses all sorts of clever tricks like trying to predict which
            path to take and only backtracking if prediction fails.
          </p>
          <p>
            You see, Ragel generates simple state machines: the building blocks
            of regular expressions. Whereas ANTLR is like a complex and
            unpredictable magic clock, Ragel state machines are totally
            transparent and predictable. I've spent many months trying to use
            ANTLR on a number of different projects and in every case
            <em>except</em> for this wikitext translator I've ended up putting
            it aside because I couldn't divine the incantations required to make
            it do its black magic. Ragel, on the other hand, is absurdly simple.
            You can build complex things out of it, but the base components are
            easily comprehensible. Compared to ANTLR, Ragel is incredibly easy
            to learn.

          <h2>January 31, 2008</h2>

          <h3 id="a003819">Farewell Rackspace</h3>

          <p>
            I wrote the other day that I was going to be
            <a
              href="https://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2008/01/moving_to_rhel.php"
              >moving to RHEL 5</a
            >
            in the near future. What I wasn't sure at the time was exactly
            <em>how</em> I'd be making the move. At the time it seemed that the
            most likely pathway was going to be installing a new drive for RHEL
            5 and migrating the data over afterwards; the exact mechanics of
            this were never really defined (would the drive have RHEL 5
            <em>pre</em>-installed on it prior to being slotted in? would they
            need to take the machine down and do the install &quot;in
            place&quot;?).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Ideally</em> my host (<a href="http://rackspace.com/"
              >Rackspace</a
            >) would have slotted in a drive with a pre-installed OS on it,
            brought the server online so I could migrate my data over to the new
            drive and <em>then</em> rebooted from the new drive. I thought they
            use identical, standard hardware configurations to allow precisely
            this kind of thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            So you'd be looking at two reboots, one of them accompanied by a few
            minutes of downtime to physically install the drive, and then a
            period in which some services didn't work properly because they'd
            need to be tweaked, set-up and configured only after booting into
            RHEL 5 for the first time. But overall impact to your website
            visitors would be fairly minimal. Once all that was done you'd be
            looking at another quick powercycle while they shut down the server
            to remove the old drive (you don't get anything for free from
            Rackspace).
          </p>
          <p>
            I wonder how often Rackspace does this type of upgrade. As it was,
            they were suprisingly slow to offer the details of the procedure and
            offer options, and that's what makes me wonder.
          </p>
          <p>
            After quite a bit of deep thought I decided that instead of staying
            with Rackspace I'd move on to another company. I've chosen
            <a href="http://inetu.net/">INetU</a>.

          <h3 id="a003802">Involuntary Reboot Log #25</h3>

          <p>
            Like I said the other day, looks like
            <a

              >this iMac is dying</a
            >. This time the machine simply turned itself off when I bumped the
            desk with my knee; it could barely even be called a bump.
          </p>
          <p>
            The average time between failures is dropping. Not long ago it was
            about one month, but now it's approaching three weeks, and if you
            look at the average over the last month the failures have been
            almost weekly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from the risk of damage to my data, I am starting to get sick
            of these Disk First Aid runs (during which the machine is unusable),
            which go especially slowly because
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Spotlight">Spotlight</a>
            decides to reindex <em>all</em> of my volumes every time I have one
            of these failures.

            in which I complained about the lack of RAM in the low-end iMacs. It
            was pointed out to me that real-world RAM really is cheap nowadays
            (even if RAM from
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple">Apple</a> is
            not). You can max out an iMac to 4 GB for a mere $100 at

            for someone like me living in Europe and buying the RAM from the US
            you're still looking at only 85€ <em>including</em> international
            shipping.

          <h3 id="a003775">Rails and validates_uniqueness_of</h3>

          <p>
            I'm a
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails">Rails</a> dabbler
            who has never actually deployed an application yet but has been
            working in spare moments on a new version of this site that will be
            powered by Rails.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was puzzled today to see excess <tt>SELECT</tt> queries whenever I
            saved a record. The queries were for attributes that were entirely
            unrelated to what I was manipulating.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll spare you the long story and cut to the chase. It turns out
            that these extra queries are generated by
            <tt>validates_uniqueness_of</tt>. I guess I should have known. The
            entire model gets validated whenever you save, even attributes that
            you haven't touched. I guess this makes sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I am not really sure about the point of
            <tt>validates_uniqueness_of</tt> because it is vulnerable to a
            classic race condition; basically Rails checks &quot;is this
            unique?&quot; and if it is goes ahead and saves the record. Of
            course, in a multi-user application it's possible that what was
            unique a millisecond again is no longer so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically <tt>validates_uniqueness_of</tt> can't provide you with
            any guarantees, and if that's the case then why bother using it? I
            had it in my app mostly for experimentation purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only robust way to approach this is to do what we always do when
            we have race conditions to worry about: go ahead and save the record
            and only if it doesn't work worry about what you'll do. In order for
            this to work you need to impose a database-level constraint which
            will cause an exception to be thrown if someone tries to create a
            duplicate (and of course, the database won't permit the creation of
            the duplicate to succeed).
          </p>
          <p>Something like this in a migration should do it:</p>
          <pre>add_index :things, :attribute, :unique =&gt; true</pre>
          <p>
            Try to insert a &quot;thing&quot; with a duplicate
            &quot;attribute&quot; and MySQL will complain about a
            &quot;Duplicate entry&quot; and Rails will duly raise an
            <tt>ActiveRecord::ActiveRecordError</tt> which you can rescue and
            deal with appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're doing that then is there any point in keeping those
            <tt>validates_uniqueness_of</tt> calls? Perhaps. I guess if the
            probability of races is low then you can keep your application logic
            simpler by relying on <tt>validates_uniqueness_of</tt> for informing
            the user nicely that &quot;that name is already taken&quot;, and
            rely on database-level constraints to handle the really nasty race
            conditions (and throw an irrecoverable error). I suppose it depends
            on how much traffic and contention you're expecting. If traffic is
            high and performance is a real issue then you might just want to get
            rid of the validation; it doesn't provide any guarantees and those
            extra queries will only slow you down.
          </p>

          <h3 id="a003774">iMac finally dying?</h3>

          <p>I'm starting to get really worried about this machine.</p>
          <p>
            Today we have the painters here painting all the rooms, which means
            that I've had to take the iMac out into the kitchen. As I've
            <a
              href="https://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/08/involuntary_reb_13.php"
              >mentioned before</a
            >, it has a wonky power socket, and this time it didn't want to boot
            up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several minutes of jiggling later I finally got the machine to turn
            on. Now I'm wondering which boot-up is going to be the last. One of
            these days the machine isn't going to power up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Financially, I'm not in a position to buy a replacement yet. The
            cheapest model costs 1,169€ here but is handicapped with only a gig
            of RAM which would probably make it slower than this machine (which
            has 2 gig) despite having a faster processor (a 2 GHz Core 2 Duo as
            opposed to the 1.83 GHz Core Duo I currently have). RAM is very
            important for performance when compiling code in
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Xcode">Xcode</a>, mostly
            due to the amount of memory occupied by precompiled headers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The top-end model would be a big improvement over my current machine
            — a 2.7 GHz Core 2 Extreme with 2 gig of RAM and a bigger screen
            (24&quot; up from 17&quot;) and hard drive (500 GB up from 160 GB) —
            but it's out of my price range at 2,159€.
          </p>
          <p>
            So really my only two options at this stage are to cross my fingers
            and hope that this machine holds up, or send it in for repair; and
            with the deadlines I have looming I just can't afford to be without
            this machine, even for a few days.

            is out, and the final 1.5.4 release is likely to come soon, probably
            before the end of the month. My favorite change in this build is the
            fix for the performance regression when commiting a single file
            specified on the
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/command%20line"

            <em>often</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The regression was only in the development version and has never
            made it into a released version of
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git">Git</a>, but I've
            been tracking the master branch for some time now (see &quot;<a

          <h3 id="a003708">Moving to RHEL 5</h3>

          <p>
            In October last year I
            <a
              href="https://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/10/thinking_about.php"
              >wrote</a
            >
            about changing UNIXes. Well, it's a new year now and it looks like
            it is going to happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll be migrating to
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/RHEL%205">RHEL 5</a>
            (from RHEL 3). I don't have a firm date for the migration yet, and I
            need to do quite a bit of research before then about the best way to
            get all my data across. This will basically be a clean install on a
            new hard drive, the server should only be down for a relatively
            short interval, and then we'll come back on line and over the
            following hours I'll be transferring user accounts, mail, databases,
            software and everything else from the old hard drive to the new. So
            it will be quite intense, and most services <em>will</em> be
            interrupted for at least some of the migration. I expect to be
            transferring and configuring for several hours, possibly even the
            entire day.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way to minimize the interruption would be to install the drive
            with the new system on it and migrate some of the data before
            rebooting, but I'm not sure how much time that will actually buy me,
            nor whether my host,
            <a
              href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&amp;siteid=41506187&amp;bfpage=hosting_headaches"
              >Rackspace</a
            >, would be prepared to do that (it would require them to install
            RHEL 5 on the drive in another machine, then uninstall it from that
            machine and reinstall it into mine).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm very happy about this because it means I will be able to
            gradually retire bits of legacy software and replace all of this
            with a single, lean, unified
            <a href="https://wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails">Rails</a>
            application which handles everything for me (bug tracking, customer
            support tracking, forums, the wiki, and so forth).
          </p>
          <p>
            Deploying Rails is a bitch by all accounts, but it's easier on RHEL
            5 than it is on RHEL 3, (specifically, there are fewer pieces of
            additional software that you have to install, and you deviate less
            from the supported, auto-updated configuration). And once you've
            deployed it you've got <em>one</em> application stack to worry about
            instead of half a dozen.

          <p>
            Only a few days since the last kernel panic and I've just had
            another hard reset. This time the machine just froze completely with
            no explanation (mouse pointer frozen, clock frozen, no visible
            movement on screen or sound from the hard drive). This machine may
            well be on its last legs.
          </p>
          <p>
            As always I did a Disk First Aid run after the crash. This time
            there was a bunch of damage that needed to be repaired. HFS+: is the
            F for Farce?

          <h3 id="a003647">On the MacBook Air</h3>

          <p>
            I admit to not being really excited about this year's keynote. I've
            been so engrossed with work of late that I didn't even know what day
            the keynote would take place. And I knew that most of the things
            that would be talked about wouldn't excite me: Apple TV (don't have
            a TV), iPhone stuff (you can't buy iPhones in the country where I
            live yet), iTunes movie rentals (I don't like the rental model, I'd
            rather own stuff). Furthermore, the machines which most interest me,
            <a
              href="https://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2008/01/the_new_mac_pro.php"
              >the Mac Pros</a
            >, were already revamped before the show started.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I must confess, even though I am not in the market to buy any
            new Apple product right now, I am <em>really</em> impressed with the
            new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook Air</a>. If I
            were to buy a laptop, this would be the one for me. I am not one of
            those people who wants their laptop to be their only machine; for
            these people the Air is not the right product. I'm a person who
            wants a portable to be portable; so for me the decision to leave out
            the optical drive is a very clever optimization. Ever since Apple
            dropped a 12&quot; model from their line-up I've felt it was a gap.
            I still have my 12&quot; PowerBook G4 (the aluminum one). It was a
            great machine and has never skipped a beat in all these years (over
            four years now, eons in computer time).
          </p>
          <p>
            So if I were to buy a laptop, the Air would be the one. The most
            portable portable ever!

          <h2>January 14, 2008</h2>

          <h3 id="a003612">Open Source economics for the small guy</h3>

          <p>
            I like the open source model. I really do think it has the potential
            to produce better software. Note that I said <em>potential</em>;
            survey the market place and you'll find examples of open source
            projects which are best-of-class and others which are severely
            lacking.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently make a bit of open source software available but also
            work on closed source stuff. If I thought i could make everything
            open source and still survive economically then I'd do it in a
            heartbeat. I suspect I'm not alone in feeling this way; as Brent
            Simmons
            <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3461"
              >recently said</a
            >:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            But I will say that, for me personally, this is a dream come true.
            Every developer wants to be able to work on the software they love,
            make a living at it, and give it to the world for free. Usually you
            get to pick two out of three — if you're lucky. Me, I get all three.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/13/1730238"
              >This very question</a
            >
            came up on Slashdot yesterday. I'm gradually edging towards
            releasing more source, but it's a difficult path to tread. I'm
            probably still quite a long way off being able to go fully open, if
            ever. Think about it: if a company like Apple can't go all the way,
            how is the small operator going to do so?
