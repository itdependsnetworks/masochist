        <p>
          The forums are now back online again, now on the new server. All of
          the members, threads and posts have been transferred across from the
          old server.

        <p>
          A hard drive failure a few days ago has forced a server migration on
          me a little sooner than I had planned.

          Calling all developers: visit piratewatch.wincent.com

        <p>
          I've launched <a href="http://piratewatch.org/">piratewatch.org</a> to
          help developers find that sweet spot where they can invest a minimal
          amount of time in fighting piracy yet maximize the effectiveness of
          their efforts. The result: a stronger business which can afford to
          invest more resources into making great products.

        <p>
          Apologies to any who had trouble connecting to or using the Wincent
          server earlier this evening. Performance was poor for a couple of
          hours due to filesystem issues. They have now been fixed.

        <p>
          As part of the site redesign, there is a new section (which you are
          reading right now), "Product and site news". This section (together
          with the <a href="/a/knowledge-base/">Knowledge base</a> section)
          takes over from the weblog at
          <a href="http://wincent.org/">wincent.org</a>, which has existed in
          one form or another since 1997...
