          I've just put a new build of the Synergy Advance version 0.4 beta on
          the server (0.4 beta 4) to correct a spurious crash warning that may
          appear on first launch. If you've already installed 0.4 beta 3 then
          there is no need to upgrade; the spurious warning appears only once.

        <p>
          A few minor disasters and an unexpected event or two have taken place
          during this last month that have set back development a bit. I'm
          making this post to let you know that a new version of Synergy is
          ready for release and the next public preview release of Synergy
          Advance will follow closely.
