          Once you have paid you will receive your license information via
          email. Messages are sent by a fully-automated system so you should
          receive the message within seconds or minutes of completing your
          payment depending on network conditions. If after waiting several
          minutes you still have not received your license notice please see

            >Frequently Asked Questions</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h4>Copying license information from your email</h4>

        <p>
          Your license notice indicates your registered email address (next to
          the label, <tt>EMAIL ADDRESS:</tt>). To prevent other people from
          using your license, license codes are cryptographically tied to the
          email address specified at the time of purchase. This means that when
          registering you must enter your email address exactly as it appears on
          the license notice. If you enter a different email address it will not
          work.
          <strong
            >Given the need for accuracy it is recommended that you use copy and
            paste to enter your email address in the purchased
            application.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          It's very important to keep backups of your license notice (both
          printed to paper and electronic, preferably burnt to a CD or DVD) so
          that if you ever lose access to your email address then you will still
          have a copy of your registration information. For security reasons,
          license codes are permanently bound to the email address used at the
          time of purchase. This is to reduce the likelihood of an outsider
          attempting to "hijack" your license by claiming to be you and then
          trying to change the address associated with the license. If you want
          to notify me of a change of address, for my own records, you can use
          <a href="https://wincent.com/a/support/update-address/">this form</a>.
          I will keep this information on file, but I won't be able to issue you
          with a new license-code for the reasons already stated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your license notice also indicates your unique license code (next to
          the label, <tt>LICENSE CODE:</tt>). The code is quite lengthy because
          it is generated using strong cryptography.
          <strong
            >Given the length of the code it is recommended that you use copy
            and paste to enter it in the purchased application.</strong
          >
          The following screen snippet shows a sample license code already
          highlighted in the mail reader, ready to be copied and pasted into the
          target application.
        </p>

        <div class="screenshots">
          <img
            src="license-email.png"
            alt="Emailed license information"
            width="313"
            height="160"
          />
        </div>

        <h4>Entering your email address</h4>

        <p>
          The following screen snippet shows what the registration panel looks
          like after pasting the sample registered email address into the first
          text field. Note that the cursor has been moved down into the first
          text field of the license code area, ready for pasting.
        </p>

        <div class="screenshots">
          <img
            src="entering-license-1.png"
            alt="Preparing to enter license code"
            width="531"
            height="429"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          You don't have to worry about any additional leading or trailing
          whitespace when performing the copy-and-paste as this will
          automatically be stripped for you. Email addresses are not
          case-sensitive, so you don't have to worry about that either.
        </p>

        <h4>Entering your license code</h4>

        <p>
          The screen snippet below shows what the registration panel looks like
          after pasting the sample license code. Note that it is not necessary
          (or desirable) to type out the entire code manually, nor should you
          paste the code in separate chunks. You can paste the entire code in
          one go and the software will automatically distribute it correctly
          across all of the text fields in the matrix. The text fields are for
          visual separation only; in reality they behave together like one big
          text field.

          You don't have to worry about any additional leading or trailing
          whitespace when performing the copy-and-paste as this will
          automatically be stripped for you. License codes are not
          case-sensitive, so you don't have to worry about that either.

        <h4>Verifying your license</h4>

        <p>
          Once you have copied and pasted both the registered email address and
          license code you can click the "Verify" button to complete the
          registration process. This is a two step process:

            <em>The application checks that your license code is valid:</em> if
            the application reports that your license code is invalid, please
            double-check that you have correctly pasted both the registration
            email address and the license code from your license notice. If
            after double-checking you are still having trouble try asking a
            friend to help; often a second pair of eyes can spot a mistake that
            may not be obvious to you. If you're unable to enter your license
            code even after asking a friend you can

            go very far beyond the information already on this page!).
