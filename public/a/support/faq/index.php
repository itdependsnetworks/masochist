            Each Wincent <a href="../../product/">product</a> has its own online
            documentation, including a list of Frequently Asked Questions (and
            answers). The FAQ you are currently reading is for general,
            site-wide questions that do not apply to any product in particular.
            If your question relates to a specific product, see the FAQ for that

          <p>
            Once you have paid you will receive your license information via
            email. Messages are sent by a fully-automated system so you should
            receive the message within seconds or minutes of completing your
            payment depending on network conditions. If after waiting several
            minutes you still have not received your license notice check the

              <em>Have you double-checked your registration email address?</em>:
              The most common reason for not receiving a license notice is
              specifying an incorrect or out-of-date email address. Please log
              in to your <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> account
              (if you paid via PayPal) or double-check with
              <a href="http://info.kagi.com/">Kagi's records</a> (if you paid
              via Kagi) and confirm the email address you have specified in your
              settings. You will need to check that account in order to receive
              your license notice. If the email address is out-of-date and you
              no longer have access to it you can
              <a href="https://wincent.com/a/support/tickets/"
                >open a support ticket</a
              >
              and request that your license code be sent to a newer address
              (please supply your full name, old email address, new email
              address, product purchased, purchase date, and receipt or
              transaction number).
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Have you checked your junk mail filters?</em>: Check that your
              license message did not get falsely identified as spam and
              diverted to your junk mail folder.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Was the message blocked by a challenge-response system?</em>:
              If you have a challenge-response system in place it may have
              bounced your license notice and prevented it from being delivered.
              Given that license notices are sent by an automated system there
              is no human that could respond to such a challenge; you'll
              therefore need to check your quarantined messages or add the
              appropriate wincent.com address to your "whitelist". Please see
              the
              <a href="https://wincent.com/a/about/spam/"
                >Wincent Anti-spam Policy page</a
              >
              for a list of outgoing wincent.com addresses that you may wish to
              add to your whitelists.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Did you pay via eCheck?</em>: If you paid using a PayPal
              "eCheck" then the transaction will not be completed until the
              payment has cleared. Just as it would for a real-world check,
              PayPal imposes a clearance delay of several days (typically about
              four business days) before allowing the funds to clear and the
              transaction to be completed. Immediately upon clearance PayPal's
              automated systems will cause your license notice to be sent to you
              via email. There is no human intervention required so there should
              be no additional delays.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You can have your license code resent to you at any time by using
            the
            <a href="https://wincent.com/a/support/registration/form.php"
              >lost license code form</a
            >
            (this is an automated system).
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that the automated systems apply to all Wincent products with
            the exception of Install;
            Install purchases are processed manually because they require
            special access to the Wincent server and must be set up manually.
            The expected processing times appear on the
            <a href="https://wincent.com/a/products/install/purchase/"

          <h4>
            <a id="which" name="which"></a>Which payments service should I use?
            PayPal or Kagi?
          </h4>

          <p>
            Wincent recommends <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>, a
            very popular payments service with over 100 million users (as of
            October 2006) and available in over 103 countries including the
            United States. PayPal will automatically handle any currency
            conversions for you and they do not charge VAT on purchases made
            from within the European Union. Using PayPal you will be able to pay
            using a variety of means including credit card, "eCheck" and Bank
            Transfer (please note that in the case of "eCheck" and "Bank
            Transfer" payments your transaction will only be classified as
            "Completed" once your check or transfer has cleared. PayPal advises
            that it takes approximately four business days for checks to be
            marked as cleared).
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="http://www.kagi.com/">Kagi</a> is provided as an
            alternative payment processor. Kagi is less popular but it does have
            a long history and an excellent reputation as a payments service for
            Macintosh software. Please note that Kagi collects VAT on all
            purchases made from within the European Union which makes PayPal a
            better choice for people living there (see the
            <a href="#vat">following FAQ</a> for more information about VAT). In
            addition, Kagi's higher merchant processing fees drive up the
            license prices; for most products Wincent absorbs these processing
            costs but in the case of products with extremely low prices such as
            <a href="https://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/"
              >Synergy</a
            >
            there is a price differential (5 Euros for licenses purchased
            through PayPal but 10 Euros for those purchased via Kagi). Kagi
            provides many payment alternatives such as money order and cash
            which makes it an excellent choice for people who do not have an
            appropriate credit card or bank account to use with PayPal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Both PayPal and Kagi provide automated systems which send you your
            license code immediately upon completion of your payment. In order
            to ensure that you get your license code as quickly as possible,
            please double-check that you have specified a current, working email
            address on a properly configured server that does not use any
            challenge/response anti-spam systems (as license codes are sent by
            an automated system which cannot reply to such challenges).
            Particularly in the case of PayPal you should check your settings
            before completing the purchase to make sure that you don't have an
            old email address set. Remember that in the case of eChecks and
            other pending payments license codes are only sent once your payment
            has cleared.
          </p>

          <h4>
            <a name="vat" id="vat"></a>I am a resident in the European Union.
            Will I have to pay VAT?
          </h4>

          <p>
            If you choose to pay using the Kagi payment service then you will
            pay VAT on your purchase. This is because as a result of the
            <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/67/31200.html"
              >legislation introduced by the EU on 1 July 2003</a
            >
            qualifying companies outside of the EU are required to collect and
            pay VAT on any sales to EU customers. Kagi has unfortunately chosen
            to &quot;comply&quot; with these new rules in a way that is not
            required by the legislation by automatically collecting VAT on all
            transactions at the correct rate depending on the purchaser's
            country and then remitting it to the appropriate agency in that
            country. This is unfortunate because it is an automatic process from
            which merchants cannot &quot;opt-out&quot;, even those like Wincent
            whose annual turnovers fall below the threshold necessary to
            activate the regulations.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you choose to pay using the PayPal payment service then you will
            not have to pay VAT on your purchase. Unlike Kagi, PayPal provides
            no mechanism for collecting and remitting VAT. This is acceptable in
            the terms of the new legislation because Wincent's annual turnover
            falls below the annual threshold above which they would be required
            to register for the VAT (for example, the threshold in the UK as
            definied in
            <a href="http://www.hmce.gov.uk/forms/notices/700-01cs.htm"
              >Notice 700/1</a
            >
            is &pound;56,000).
          </p>

          <p class="more">[<a href="#top">Back to top...</a>]</p>

          <h4>
            <a id="refunds" name="refunds"></a>What is the Wincent refund
            policy?
          </h4>

          <p>
            All sales are final and not refundable. Trial versions are available
            for download and evaluation so take advantage of the trial period to
            make an informed decision about whether to purchase a license.
            Wincent may waive this policy at its discretion under the
            appropriate circumstances; for example, if you accidentally hit the
            &quot;Buy&quot; button twice and end up buying two licenses only
            seconds apart when you intended to buy only one then Wincent will
            refund the duplicate payment on request.
