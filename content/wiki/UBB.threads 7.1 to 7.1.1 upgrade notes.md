title: UBB.threads 7.1 to 7.1.1 upgrade notes
---

A little tired of doing multi-step manual upgrades to [UBB.threads](/wiki/UBB.threads) (for example, see the notes for the last upgrade, "[UBB.threads 7.0.2 to 7.1 upgrade notes](/wiki/UBB.threads_7.0.2_to_7.1_upgrade_notes)"), I decided to come up with a shell script that would at least guide the process.

The basic procedure is as follows:

1.  Download new version from Members Area: <http://www.infopop.com/members/members.php>
2.  Log in to control panel and close board
3.  Backup the database
4.  Backup the installed files
5.  Temporarily relax permissions (so that the uploads will work)
6.  Perform the upload using [Interarchy](/wiki/Interarchy)'s Auto Upload feature
7.  Restore the permissions
8.  Run the upgrade script `install/upgrade.php` from within the browser
9.  Remove the install directory from the server
10. Open the forums again

Quite tedious to do all this manually, especially if you have more than one install to upgrade.

# The script

The script does as much of the work as possible, prompting when some sort of external action is required that it can't perform (such as closing the control panel or uploading the files).

Here is the first draft of the script. It is customized for my own setup and not something that you could drop-in to your own server and expect things to work; nevertheless it may give some ideas.

    #!/bin/sh
    # $Id$

    # update for each new version
    OLD_VERSION="7_1"

    # set and forget
    BACKUP1="wincent_ubb_${OLD_VERSION}"
    BACKUP2="pw_ubb_${OLD_VERSION}"
    USERNAME1=blah
    DATABASE1=blah
    USERNAME2=blah
    DATABASE2=blah
    INSTALL1=/path/to/forums
    INSTALL2=/path/to/other/forums
    APACHE1=user
    APACHE2=user

      echo "  - styles"
      echo "  - cache_builders/custom"
      echo "Once uploading is complete, will revert permissions to their former state."
      echo "Please indicate that you have finished uploading:"
      continue_or_abort
    }

    continue_or_abort()
    {
      echo
      read -n 1 -p "Press Y to continue, A to abort: " RESPONSE
      if [ "$RESPONSE" = "Y" -o "$RESPONSE" = "y" ]; then
        echo
        return
      else

        echo "Aborting!"

# Cleanup

Although the script as shown worked for me in the 7.1 to 7.1.1 upgrade, the [UBB.threads](/wiki/UBB.threads) upgrade script itself is not infallible. I had another install that had not yet been upgraded to 7.1, and on updating the language files [UBB.threads](/wiki/UBB.threads) introduced a syntax error into one of the files that I had to go in and fix manually.

I then ran the following command to make sure that there were no other errors anywhere in the install:

    find . -name "*.php" -exec php -l {} \;

This found one other minor error elsewhere in the installation, so I recommend running this sweeping check before and after any [UBB.threads](/wiki/UBB.threads) upgrade, just in case.
