title: List of wiki redirects
---

I currently abuse [wiki](/wiki/wiki) links throughout the site as a means of quickly inserting shortcuts to key pages.

For example, when I type `[[ticket]]`, that creates a link to the wiki page, <https://wincent.dev/wiki/ticket>, which is set up to redirect to the "new ticket" page at <https://wincent.dev/issues/new>. So in essence, it's just laziness so that I don't have to type `[/issues/new ticket]`.

In reality, typing `[/issues/new ticket]` isn't so bad. But that's something I couldn't do until Wikitext version 1.4.0; prior to that I had to use full URLs (`[https://wincent.dev/issues/new ticket]`). That was cumbersome and also caused inappropriate "external link" icons to appear next to all such links.

This page exists to serve as a reminder of which wiki article titles are currently being "abused" in this way.

## Redirects within this application

-   [support ticket](/wiki/support_ticket) (for opening a new support ticket)
-   [ticket](/wiki/ticket) (for opening a new ticket)
-   [forum](/wiki/forum) and [forums](/wiki/forums)
-   [issue tracker](/wiki/issue_tracker)
-   [login](/wiki/login)
-   [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy): redirects to <https://wincent.dev/products/synergy>

## Redirects to parts of the old site

-   [Synergy Advance](/wiki/Synergy_Advance): redirects to <http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-advance/>

## Redirects to external sites

I normally don't redirect to external sites, preferring instead to link to a wiki page where I can add comments and other annotations in addition to a link to the external site (example: [Subversion](/wiki/Subversion)).

There is currently one exception; as my childhood friend Sho needs no introduction, the [Sho Fukamachi](/wiki/Sho_Fukamachi) page redirects to <http://fukamachi.org/> directly.
