title: OS X install notes (March 2013)
---

Notes made moving from dying old machine to newer one with a smaller hard drive.

Because the hard drive was half the size, I did a by-hand migration, bringing across only the essential elements. I was also under tight time pressure, so I ended up taking some short cuts that I normally would have avoided (for example, using Homebrew, and letting it "own" `/usr/local` and impose its preference for having my main user run as an administrator; this breaks with my long practice of running as an unprivileged user).
