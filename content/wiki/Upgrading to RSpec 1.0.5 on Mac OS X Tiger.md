title: Upgrading to RSpec 1.0.5 on Mac OS X Tiger
---

These notes were made while upgrading from [RSpec 1.0.4](/wiki/RSpec_1.0.4) to [RSpec 1.0.5](/wiki/RSpec_1.0.5) on [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) [Tiger](/wiki/Tiger).

Once gain, like the last upgrade (see "[Upgrading to RSpec 1.0.4 on Mac OS X Tiger](/wiki/Upgrading_to_RSpec_1.0.4_on_Mac_OS_X_Tiger)"), there was no corresponding [Spec::UI](/wiki/Spec%3a%3aUI) upgrade.

# Pre-testing

First double check that all [specs](/wiki/specs) are passing for [Walrus](/wiki/Walrus). This is a good check because there are a _lot_ of specifications, many of them containing numerous assertions:

    # from the top-level directory of the Walrus source tree:
    rake spec

# Download and install

    sudo gem install rspec

## Output

# [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate)

This time seeing as I had [some local changes](http://typechecked.net/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/05/rspec_changes.php) to my [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate) bundle I didn't want to perform the normal upgrade procedure:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/RSpec.tmbundle
    svn up

Instead, I wanted to preview what the `svn up` would do before actually trying it (see '[Previewing an "svn up" without actually doing it](/wiki/Previewing_an_%22svn_up%22_without_actually_doing_it)' for more info):

    # see uncommitted differences in my working copy
    svn st

    # see differences between my working copy and the current head
    svn diff -r HEAD

    # proceed with the update
    svn up

## Output

    U    Support/lib/spec_mate.rb
    U    Support/spec/fixtures/example_failing_spec.rb
    U    Support/spec/fixtures/example_passing_spec.rb
    U    Support/spec/spec_mate_spec.rb
    Updated to revision 2085.

## After updating

Normally, if [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate) is running, from the [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate) "Bundles" menu, open the "Bundle Editor" submenu and select "Reload Bundles".

# [Rails](/wiki/Rails)

I have a [Rails](/wiki/Rails) project where [rspec](/wiki/rspec) is installed as a plug-in. The `--force` switch is necessary in order to install over the previously installed copy. I decided to change from using specific tags this time, so instead of:

    # from inside the Rails application top-level directory
    script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_5/rspec
    script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_5/rspec_on_rails

I did:

    script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/CURRENT/rspec
    script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/CURRENT/rspec_on_rails

See if any other changes are necessary:

    script/generate rspec --pretend

There were no substantive changes (previewable by hitting `d`) so I opted not to replace any files (by hitting `n`).

# Cleaning up old versions of installed [gems](/wiki/gems)

I also took the opportunity to clean up some older versions of the installed [gems](/wiki/gems).

    sudo gem cleanup

## Output

    Cleaning up installed gems...
    Attempting uninstall on rspec-1.0.4
    Successfully uninstalled rspec version 1.0.4
    Clean Up Complete

For more information on removing old [gems](/wiki/gems), see "[Removing older versions of installed gems](/wiki/Removing_older_versions_of_installed_gems)".
