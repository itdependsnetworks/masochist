title: Resilio Sync
---

I started using [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/) in late 2023 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilio_Sync)). Design is very similar to [Syncthing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncthing), but has an iOS client, and it's the latter that determined the choice when I was looking at alternatives to [Sync](/wiki/Sync).
