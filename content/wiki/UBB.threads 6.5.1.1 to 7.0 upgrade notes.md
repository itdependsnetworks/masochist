# Backup

-   Log in to control panel and close board
-   Copy text from control panel, "Display Options", "General", "HTML Includes"
-   Perform backup of database:

<!-- -->

    mysqldump --opt -u USERNAME -p -h localhost DATABASE_NAME | \
      bzip2 -c > BACKUP_FILE.sql.bz2

# Installation

-   Create a new database for the new forums:

<!-- -->

    mysql -u root -p
    CREATE DATABASE new_db_name;
    GRANT ALL ON new_db_name.* TO 'new_user_name'@'localhost';
    SET PASSWORD FOR 'new_user_name'@'localhost' = OLD_PASSWORD('new_password');
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

(The `OLD_PASSWORD` trick is necessary because [UBB.threads](/wiki/UBB.threads) will be connecting to the database using PHP, and the version of PHP on the server is compiled against a pre-4.1 version of the MySQL libraries; see [this page on password hashing](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/password-hashing.html) for more information.)

-   Create new forums directory:

<!-- -->

    sudo -u WEB_USER mkdir new-forums
    sudo -u WEB_USER /bin/echo "Forums currently unavailable while upgrade is in progress" > \
      new-forums/index.html

-   Move old forums out-of-the-way:

<!-- -->

    sudo -u WEB_USER mv forums old-forums
    sudo -u WEB_USER mv new-forums forums

-   Install the new forums according to the instructions into `new-forums`:

<!-- -->

    sudo -u WEB_USER mkdir new-forums

-   Upload the files into, then set permissions and move new forums into place:

<!-- -->

    cd new-forums
    sudo chmod 777 includes
    sudo chmod 666 includes/*
    sudo chmod 777 sessions
    sudo chmod 777 templates/compile
    sudo chmod 777 templates
    sudo chmod 777 cache
    sudo chmod 777 cache_builders
    sudo chmod 777 cache_builders/custom
    sudo chmod 666 cache_builders/custom/*
    sudo chmod 777 styles
    sudo chmod 666 styles/*.php styles/*.css
    cd ..
    sudo rm -r forums
    sudo mv new-forums forums

-   Run the upgrade script at: <http://example.com/path_to_forums/install/install.php>
-   Use a custom cookie prefix to prevent cookies from other apps (such as [Bugzilla](/wiki/Bugzilla)) from interfering with the forums.
-   As this is an upgrade installation, do not create an admin user; instead proceed directly to the "Creating your tables" step.

# Import

-   Upload importer script
-   Execute in browser

<!-- -->

    Importing Banned Host: NULL
    Script:
    Line#:
    SQL Error:
    SQL Error #: 0
    Query: insert into ubbt_BANNED_HOSTS values ( NULL )

On investigation:

    mysql> USE old_database_name;
    mysql> SELECT * FROM w3t_Banned;
    +------------+
    | B_Hostname |
    +------------+
    | NULL       |
    +------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)

    mysql> delete from w3t_Banned;

Inspection of the `threads_import.php` script indicated that it would probably be safe to go back and pick up import from where it left off by visiting: <http://example.com/path_to_forums/importers/threads_import.php?ubb=extras>

Only glitch at end is that I saw some [PHP](/wiki/PHP) warnings with regard to my `open_basedir` restriction; may have to disable that for the forums directory.

# Cleanup

Due to permissions errors I'm temporarily turning off [PHP](/wiki/PHP)Â [Safe Mode](/wiki/Safe_Mode) within the forums directory and changing the ownership on all files:

    cd path_to_forums
    sudo chown -R apache_user:apache_group *

-   Drop old database

<!-- -->

    USE mysql;
    DROP DATABASE old_database_name;
    DELETE FROM user WHERE User = 'old_username';
    DELETE FROM db WHERE Db = 'old_database_name';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-   Remove old forum files
-   Upload redirection scripts so that old links will continue to work
-   Delete `importers` and `install` subdirectories
