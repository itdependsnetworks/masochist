title: Build numbers
---

When writing up the article "[Setting up a nightly build system](/wiki/Setting_up_a_nightly_build_system)" I implemented a system that used a [build number](/wiki/build_number) based on the current [Subversion](/wiki/Subversion) revision of the code base. The revision number appeared in brackets after the main version number; for example:

    3.1.1 (365)

I've decided to implement something similar for all of my builds, not just the nightly ones.

# The old system

The old system used a script (part of the [Wincent Build Tools](/wiki/Wincent_Build_Tools)) to increment a build number on every build whenever there had been changes in the source tree since the last build. New release builds caused the build number to be bumped up by 1.0 and new debug builds caused it to be bumped up by 0.1. So, for example, if we started at build number 250.0 and performed various release builds we would pass through 251.0, 252.0, 253.0 and so forth; if we then did a series of debug builds the build number would go from 253.0 to 253.1, 253.2, 253.3 and so forth.

This system worked well but it was somewhat arbitrary. Using [Subversion](/wiki/Subversion) revision numbers is a better alternative because it is deterministic and precise. The build number can then be used as a direct indicator of the exact source code that was used to produce a particular build.

Below is the text of the old version of the script, just prior to modification. The new system makes almost all of this script entirely redundant; all that's left is the code for updating the copyright year and that could be replaced with a one-line [Perl](/wiki/Perl) script:

    # first instance of the following line is updated, if present:

    #
    # The file containing the versioning information should not be updated by hand
    # because its content is "brittle" and changing it may prevent this script from
    # updating the information.

# The new system

Like the nightly build system, the new system is able to avoid gratuitous changes to the [Subversion](/wiki/Subversion) repository caused by changes to the build number. Instead of storing the build number in a file that is checked into the repository we are now free to dynamically create the file before building and throw it away afterwards; it can be ignored.

I've written and [added a new script](http://typechecked.net/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/03/buildtools_r51_1_item_changed.php) to the [Wincent Build Tools](/wiki/Wincent_Build_Tools) that when run in a checked out [SVK](/wiki/SVK) working copy uses `svk info` to extract the current [Subversion](/wiki/Subversion) revision number. The [Subversion](/wiki/Subversion) revision number is used because it is more authoritative (because it refers to a central repository). A [later revision](http://typechecked.net/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/04/buildtools_r67_1_item_changed.php) of the script only writes out the file containing the version number if it has actually changed; this helps to avoid triggering gratuitous rebuilds.
