title: Causing Anacron jobs to run immediately
---

Can do this for testing purposes:

```shell
# anacron -fn           # kick off the jobs
# tail -f /var/log/cron # monitor the logs
```

ie.

-   `-f` to force execution, ignoring timestamps.
-   `-n` to ignore delay specifications (not sure if this is actually needed, but as you can see I used it anyway).
-   `-s` (implied by `-n`) to run jobs serially instead of in parallel.
