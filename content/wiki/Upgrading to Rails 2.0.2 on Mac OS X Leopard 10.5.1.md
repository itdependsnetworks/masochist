# Cleaning up older versions of installed [gems](/wiki/gems)

The current version of [RubyGems](/wiki/RubyGems) seems to have a bug in which the `gem cleanup` command doesn't actually remove all of the old versions that it could; it seems to only remove the second-to-latest version, thus requiring you to run it several times:

# Updating an existing [Rails](/wiki/Rails) application

I thought this would be very straightforward as I was just upgrading from 2.0RC2 to 2.0.2, but my first attempt at this failed miserably:

    $ cd path_to_rails_application_root
    $ rake rails:freeze:gems
    Freezing to the gems for Rails 2.0.2
    rake aborted!
    uninitialized constant Gem::GemRunner

    (See full trace by running task with --trace)

At this point [Rails](/wiki/Rails) had deleted itself from the `vendor` directory (and not for the [first time](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/11/version_control.php)), which would obviously be very, very bad news if this were a production system; luckily it is only a development one and I am managing the project with [Git](/wiki/Git) so I was able to restore the destroyed files with a quick:

    # note that I have a "co" alias defined for "checkout"
    git co vendor/rails

[RubyGems](/wiki/RubyGems) and [Rake](/wiki/Rake) are both already up-to-date on my system:

    $ gem -v
    1.0.1
    $ rake --version
    rake, version 0.8.1

There are [plenty of posts](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22uninitialized+constant+Gem::GemRunner%22+rails) about this kind of problem that can be found with [Google](/wiki/Google). For example, [this post](http://www.nickpeters.net/2007/12/31/fix-for-uninitialized-constant-gemgemrunner-nameerror/) from 31 December 2007 states that the problem is caused by a missing `require` in `/usr/bin/gem`; inspection reveals however that the needed lines are already present in the installed version:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'rubygems/gem_runner'

[This post](http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?pid=48963) claims that the problem is caused by an additional `gem1.8` symlink that is installed when you do a `gems update --system`, but no such symlink is present in my `/usr/bin/` directory nor anywhere else on my system. [This post](http://blog.ra66i.org/archives/informatics/2007/12/23/a-quick-gem-101-faq-gemrunner-name-error/) explains why it's not present on my system (basically, if your [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) is installed as `ruby18` then your `gem` command will be installed as `gem18` too).

Some of the other links I trawled through:

-   <http://bpdp.wordpress.com/2007/11/28/rubygems-095-and-rails-126-uninitialized-constant-gemgemrunner/>
-   <http://jhernandez.gpltarragona.org/blog/?p=621>
-   <http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/133792>
-   <http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/136010>
-   <http://blog.ra66i.org/archives/informatics/2007/12/23/a-quick-gem-101-faq-gemrunner-name-error/>
-   <http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/browse_thread/thread/d3e96496eca8735c>

One of the suggested techniques was to "unfreeze" [Rails](/wiki/Rails) (ie. remove it) from the `vendor` directory to force use of the newly installed 2.0.2 instead. This didn't work out too well:

    # or git rm -r vendor/rails if you want Git to track this
    $ rm -r vendor/rails

    # now try freezing again
    $ rake rails:freeze:gems
    Missing the Rails 1.99.1 gem. Please `gem install -v=1.99.1 rails`, update your RAILS_GEM_VERSION setting in config/environment.rb for the Rails version you do have installed, or comment out RAILS_GEM_VERSION to use the latest version installed.

    # ok, so let's do what it asks us to do
    $ sudo gem install -v=1.99.1 rails
    Password:
    ERROR:  could not find rails locally or in a repository

    # let's try our other option:
    # comment out the RAILS_GEM_VERSION config/environment.rb and try again
    $ rake rails:freeze:gems
    Freezing to the gems for Rails 2.0.2
    Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/activesupport-2.0.2'
    Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/activerecord-2.0.2'
    Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/actionpack-2.0.2'
    Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/actionmailer-2.0.2'
    Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/activeresource-2.0.2'
    Unpacked gem: 'app/vendor/rails/rails-2.0.2'

So that seems to have worked. Proceed to update the application files:

    rails .

Now hand-update `config/environment.rb` to include:

    RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.0.2' unless defined? RAILS_GEM_VERSION

So it all seems to be fine now, but it's certainly left a bad taste in my mouth. This should have been a very basic, routine upgrade. Did I shoot myself in the foot by cleaning up the old [gems](/wiki/gems) before trying to freeze the new version of [Rails](/wiki/Rails)? Should that kind of thing _matter_? How can you deploy this teetering stack in any kind of "enterprise" environment and feel secure about it?
