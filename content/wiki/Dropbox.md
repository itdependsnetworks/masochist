[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) is the "incumbent" cloud file storage solution for consumers. I migrated away from it, due to concerns with the direction of the product, to [Sync](/wiki/Sync) and later to a non-cloud based file synchronization solution called [Resilio Sync](/wiki/Resilio_Sync).
