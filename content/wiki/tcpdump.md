# A `tcpdump` case study

Here are some notes I made this week while trying to troubleshoot unstable SSH connections. I barely know how to meaningfully use `tcpdump`, so there are probably better resources out there, but I want to record this stuff in case it comes in handy to me in the future.

## The problem

I was seeing SSH connections to codespaces routinely die after only a few minutes, even while being actively used, as soon as I used my laptop away from my desk. The same laptop, on the same WiFi connection, could hold a stable connection to a codespace for hours if plugged into the Thunderbolt dock. This was a bit weird because the dock in question is not connected via ethernet to anything that was powered up, nor does it have any other kind of active network connection.

In the end, I never did actually get to the bottom or the mystery (ðŸ¤¦) but I did get some practice at using some network tools along the way. A reboot of the laptop, which had an uptime of about a month during the investigation, seemed to make things better at first, but the problems returned the next day.

Things I know:

- Problem doesn't just affect codespaces, nor just corporate-managed remote hosts, but any SSH host, including personal EC2 boxes that I have access to.
- Problem doesn't affect my personal laptop, only my work laptop (as such, I can't rule out corporate fleet management and security software as the real cause here); both of these machines are running the latest version of macOS at the time of writing (12.4 AKA Monterey).
- Problem manifests both when the connection is idle and when it is being actively used.
- Problem manifests both on and off the corporate VPN.
- Problem manifests on multiple network SSIDs (verified on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks).
- Problem manifests even entirely _within_ home network (ie. SSH-ing into another host on my local network).
- Problem isn't about power (ie. plugging into a power adapter does _not_ make the problem go away; only the mystical properties of the dock stave off the problem).
- SSH setting `ControlMaster auto` vs `ControlMaster no` makes no difference.
- SSH setting `TCPKeepAlive no` vs `TCPKeepAlive yes` (default) makes no difference.
- When multiple connections are open (eg. 2 to a codespace, 1 to another corporate remote host, 1 to an EC2 host), all go down at the same time.
- Remote hosts all have default settings (so `TCPKeepAlive yes` potentially _is_ an issue there).

## The investigation

Via [this cheatsheet](https://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpdump/) I knew that I could identify SSH connections with this command, irrespective of ports, by looking for the banner response:

```
tcpdump 'tcp[(tcp[12]>>2):4] = 0x5353482D'
```

Here's an example of me connecting to an EC2 host:

```
12:42:02.588173 IP 192.168.1.129.55754 > unixhosts.net.ssh: Flags [P.], seq 4226760049:4226760070, ack 3514525375, win 2070, options [nop,nop,TS val 1355848698 ecr 443177270], length 21
12:42:02.705315 IP unixhosts.net.ssh > 192.168.1.129.55754: Flags [P.], seq 1:22, ack 21, win 210, options [nop,nop,TS val 443177389 ecr 1355848698], length 21
```

This won't work for codespaces, however, because when using the `gh cs ssh` tool it's doing some magic to manage and proxy the connection for you. `ps auxwww | grep ssh` reveals an SSH connection going to localhost, but if you want to see the real traffic, you have to figure out what port the `gh`-powered proxy is using to get to the remote host. I was able to do this by making educated guesses from the `netstat` output and then monitoring them for traffic.

### Other useful commands

Show all network interfaces:

```
networksetup -listallhardwareports
```

Analyzing captured traffic with `tcptrace`:

```
# Example: having identified port 63433 as interesting, capture all traffic to/from it:
sudo tcpdump -vv -i lo0 port 63433 -w /tmp/out # a bit gibberishy
brew install tcptrace
tcptrace /tmp/out
tcptrace -l /tmp/out # Shows more info.
```

Seeing hung connections in `netstat`:

```
Active Internet connections
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp4     504      0  localhost.64929        localhost.64931        ESTABLISHED
tcp4       0      0  localhost.64931        localhost.64929        ESTABLISHED
```

So, the connection is established, but `Rec-Q` shows:

> The count of bytes not copied by the user program connected to this socket.

Monitoring "alive" traffic to another host:

```
ssh -o LogLevel=DEBUG -o ControlMaster=no -o TCPKeepAlive=no -o ServerAliveCountMax=1000 -o ServerAliveInterval=1 -vvvv $SOME_EC2_HOST
netstat | grep $SOME_EC2_HOST # To get port.
sudo tcpdump -vvv -xx -i all port 59301 # To monitor; -xx prints entire packet.
```

Showing route and ping between local machine and remote:

```
sudo mtr $REMOTE_EC2_HOST
```

Oddly enough, even a lowly `ping` of a host on the local network fails this hard when the network goes down; ie. first some request timeouts, then a broken pipe:

```
...
64 bytes from 192.168.1.131: icmp_seq=692 ttl=64 time=5.543 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.131: icmp_seq=693 ttl=64 time=87.783 ms
Request timeout for icmp_seq 694
Request timeout for icmp_seq 695
Request timeout for icmp_seq 696
Request timeout for icmp_seq 697
zsh: broken pipe  ping example.local
```

On another occasion, it suddenly started claiming `no route to host`:

```
64 bytes from 192.168.1.131: icmp_seq=648 ttl=64 time=68.470 ms
Request timeout for icmp_seq 649
Request timeout for icmp_seq 650
Request timeout for icmp_seq 651
Request timeout for icmp_seq 652
ping: sendto: No route to host
Request timeout for icmp_seq 653
ping: sendto: No route to host
Request timeout for icmp_seq 654
ping: sendto: No route to host
```

Eventually, it recovered (ie. exited with a broken pipe, but I was able to resume/reconnect straight afterwards). Note that when this happens, I can't even ping my _router_ IP.

Looking into ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), the cached mapping between IP addresses and Ethernet (MAC, or "Media Access Control") addresses.

`arp -a` on 2.5 GHz WiFi:

```
? (192.168.1.1) at e0:19:54:5d:d1:b0 on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
? (192.168.1.129) at a0:78:17:9e:71:bd on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]
? (224.0.0.251) at 1:0:5e:0:0:fb on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]
```

- 192.168.1.1 is the router.
- 192.168.1.129 is the problem laptop.
- [The 224.0.0.251 address](https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/a/51958) is [for multicast on the local network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address).

`arp -a` on 5 GHz WiFi:

```
? (192.168.1.1) at e0:19:54:5d:d1:b0 on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
? (192.168.1.131) at a4:b1:c1:91:47:9f on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
? (192.168.1.255) at ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
? (224.0.0.251) at 1:0:5e:0:0:fb on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]
? (239.255.255.250) at 1:0:5e:7f:ff:fa on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]
```

- 192.168.1.131 is the local network test host that I've been `ping`-ing.
- 192.168.1.255 is a broadcast address; not sure why the other network didn't have that.
- 239.255.255.250 is also a ["Organization-Local Scope" multicast address](https://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses/multicast-addresses.xhtml); at first I thought that was because I'm on a VPN on this network, but it turns out that the VPN dropped anyway (although it's possible that it's cached); in any case, if I `ping -c 239.255.255.250` I get a reply back from my laptop.
- Note the laptop is gone. It appears if I re-run `arp -a` after a `ping 192.168.1.129`:

From [RFC 2365](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2365.html), here's a definition of what the "administratively scoped multicast address" (ie. the "organization-local scope") means:

> The key properties of administratively scoped IP multicast are that (i). packets addressed to administratively scoped multicast addresses do not cross configured administrative boundaries, and (ii). administratively scoped multicast addresses are locally assigned, and hence are not required to be unique across administrative boundaries.

Running again:

```
192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) at e0:19:54:5d:d1:b0 on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
192.168.1.129 (192.168.1.129) at a0:78:17:9e:71:bd on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]
192.168.1.131 (192.168.1.131) at a4:b1:c1:91:47:9f on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
192.168.1.255 (192.168.1.255) at ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
? (224.0.0.251) at 1:0:5e:0:0:fb on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]
? (239.255.255.250) at 1:0:5e:7f:ff:fa on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]
```

Evidently this cache is pretty short-lived; running a few minutes later I get the following (the broadcast address is now gone)[^again]:

```
192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1) at e0:19:54:5d:d1:b0 on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
192.168.1.129 (192.168.1.129) at a0:78:17:9e:71:bd on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]
192.168.1.131 (192.168.1.131) at a4:b1:c1:91:47:9f on en0 ifscope [ethernet]
? (224.0.0.251) at 1:0:5e:0:0:fb on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]
? (239.255.255.250) at 1:0:5e:7f:ff:fa on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]
```

[^again]: And if I run it again a few minutes later, the broadcast address is back.

So I tried watching ping and low-level network traffic at same time (hard to do this to router, as there is too much traffic and I don't know how to filter it without discarding something potentially useful as well):

```
sudo -v # cache credentials, so I can background tcpdump without missing the prompt
sudo tcpdump -nle host 192.168.1.131 &
ping 192.168.1.131
```

Ping times to router are lower than to test host, but probably not suspiciously so.

Here is a section where we see pings fail for a while and then recover:

Around the same time we see two dropped packets for our `ping` to the router, but it recovers quickly:

```

As another test, I am running a ping from the Linux box to the router to see if that one is stable or not... I confirmed that when the Mac lost its network connection, the Linux box did not (that is, on reconnecting to it, and getting back into the tmux session with the `ping` commands running, I could see no lost packets).

Other things I notice:

- Ping times to router are fast (1 to 4 ms).
- Ping times to M1 laptop are slower, but also highly variable (7 to 8 ms as median, but regularly spiking as high as 200ms).
- Ping times to Google (IPv6) are a steady 7 to 8 ms (due to their [extensive use](https://serverfault.com/questions/423668/why-is-ping-to-google-servers-and-google-dns-so-low) of local ["Anycast" addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast)).

I compared ping times to my other Mac laptop to see if they were as variable, and it looks like they are just as variable, and additionally they're also slower, although there don't seem to be as many lost packets... Snippets from `mtr`:

```
# M1

  Packets               Pings
Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
 0.4%   247    5.5   7.5   3.3 107.2  11.1

# Mid-2015

  Packets               Pings
Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
 0.0%   129    3.5  41.6   2.7 114.0  36.5
```

Ping times in the reverse direction (from either laptop to the Linux host) seem prone to bursts of variability as well:

```
# M1

  Packets               Pings
Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
 0.0%   127   75.9  31.2   4.6 138.5  35.3

# Mid-2015
  Packets               Pings
Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
 0.0%   166    3.9  21.7   3.2 151.6  33.2
 ```

They're definitely bursts, as can be seen in this output, where we see a run of low times (5 to 6 ms) followed by turbulence (up to about 55ms) and then back to the low times again:

In general, the macOS network stack doesn't seem up to snuff, as seen in this short burst of "flood" traffic:

```shell
$ sudo ping -c 1000 -f localhost
1000 packets transmitted, 737 packets received, 26.3% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.015/0.024/0.097/0.008 ms
```

vs Linux, which handles a longer flood with zero packet loss:

```shell
$ sudo ping -c 10000 -f localhost
10000 packets transmitted, 10000 received, 0% packet loss, time 66ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.001/0.002/0.025/0.000 ms, ipg/ewma 0.006/0.001 ms
```

Searching for "WiFi ping spikes macOS" and such turns up some gems among an absolute deluge of garbage results â€” suggesting that Mac networking problems like this, and variations on it, are commonplace â€” which mostly consist of [advice which is almost certain to do nothing but waste a bunch of time, like seen on this thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253352921) to:

1. Delete temporary internet files.
2. Restart router.
3. Boot in safe mode.
4. Create a new admin user.
5. Reset NVRAM.
6. Remove Login Items.
7. Scan for malware.
8. Restore from backup.
9. Reinstall macOS.

Others like [this one](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/97805) unhelpfully dismiss the spikes as normal with the following observation:

> Most Wi-Fi hardware only has a single radio, and that radio must be tuned to a specific channel. Thus, the hardware can only work on one channel at a time.
>
> However, there are situations where a STA need to switch channels ... While itâ€™s on that temporary channel, the STA canâ€™t be on the channel itâ€™s using to communicating with the AP, and thus you see spikes in latency.

Anyway, some example gems include:

- https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/263638/macbook-pro-experiencing-ping-spikes-to-local-router
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19587701/what-is-awdl-apple-wireless-direct-link-and-how-does-it-work

Which together provide some handy tips:

If we run `ping` with a low interval (`-i 0.25`) and (`--apple-time`) to show timestamps, we can run until we see a connection interruption:

```
13:44:04.257858 64 bytes from 192.168.1.131: icmp_seq=1266 ttl=64 time=80.101 ms
13:44:04.463640 64 bytes from 192.168.1.131: icmp_seq=1267 ttl=64 time=31.052 ms
13:44:04.770186 64 bytes from 192.168.1.131: icmp_seq=1268 ttl=64 time=82.272 ms
ping: sendto: No route to host
Request timeout for icmp_seq 1269
ping: sendto: No route to host
Request timeout for icmp_seq 1270
zsh: broken pipe  ping 192.168.1.131 -i 0.25 --apple-time
```

Meanwhile on the remote host, we run something so we can see when the connection freezes (eg. `watch --differences=permanent -n 0.1 date`):

```
Every 0.1s: date                                 example: Fri Jul 22 13:43:55 2022

Fri 22 Jul 2022 13:43:55 CEST
```

On the Mac, hold down option and click on the WiFi menu, then select "Enable Wi-Fi Logging..." and `tail -f /var/log/wifi.log` shows us:

FWIW, I think all the `APPLE80211_M_RSSI_CHANGED` events are innocuous (RSSI stands for "Received Signal Strength Indicator"), but it remains a mystery why `reachable` would go to `no` like that.

Additional info can be seen with `sudo log stream | grep -iE --color 'location|wireless|awdl|phone|rapport|sharing|handoff'` (although sadly, no smoking gun).

I was initially suspicious that AWDL (responsible for AirDrop and other "magic") might be at fault, but stopping it with `sudo ifconfig awdl0 down` did not seem to help. Likewise, I don't think any location-based services as mentioned in the Stack Overflow link above are at play, as there is nothing in the logs to corroborate and I have almost nothing turned on.

Trying to catch it again, but other (non-starter) ideas include seeing if it is Bluetooth related.

We see this right when the `ping` dies:

```

I think it is unrelated... I'll close Network preferences pane (which kills the `com.apple.preference.network.remoteservice` process) and see if I can repro. I can, this time we see this at the time the `ping` dies:

Just in case iStat menus is involved, I removed current location from clock menu, and removed its access to location services:

Nope, it happened again:

_Actually_ turning it off is going to be problematic (due to headphones + Trackpad), but we test it anyway:

Even with Bluetooth off, WiFi logs show a bunch of Bluetooth-related messages (albeit, one of them at least says `BT: OFF`):

Now comparing what I see in the logs when docked. Not sure what logs I could include here as I'm looking for a negative result... Really, nothing much happens other than this (perhaps only this):

`log stream` shows lots of Carbon Black stuff:

Seeing if I can rule out Carbon Black by sending it `SIGSTOP` and monitoring for a while.

```
ps auxww | grep CbOsxSensorService # see there's only one match
kill -STOP <pid> # at around 15:35
kill -CONT <pid> # at end of test, around 15:40
```

It wasn't Carbon Black, so no smoking gun. (At least, it wasn't the sensor process; although there are other processes.)

Remaining things to try:

- Turn off Location Services (wholesale); this can't remain like that due to corporate policy, but I can do a test at least.
- Turn off auto-joining (require admin to make changes too).
- Do WiFi log analysis on personal laptop, for comparison.

## Final "resolution"

This is immensely unsatisfying, but I did "resolve" the issue in the end without really understanding the root cause. I did this by deleting some preference files and rebooting.

These are the files I got rid of:

- `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist`
- `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist`
- `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist`
- `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist`

I even did a textual diff to see what changed between those files and the new files created by the operating system; while there was some churn, nothing in there looked overtly suspicious (and it's a corporate machine so I don't want to post the actual diffs here in case I inadvertently disclose something sensitive), so I might never know what the root cause really was.
