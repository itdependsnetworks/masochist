title: Killing a hung SSH connection
---

As per [this StackExchange tip](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/36691/158927), you can kill a frozen/hung SSH session with `~.` (note that you may have to press Enter first). This can be useful when the connection itself is dead and so tricks like Control-C have no effect.
