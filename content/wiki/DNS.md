[DNS](/wiki/DNS), or the [Domain Name System](/wiki/Domain_Name_System), is infrastructure that enables clients on a network to translate human-readable symbolic addresses like "wincent.dev" to their numeric [IP](/wiki/IP) addresses (209.235.192.161). DNS is often also used as a short hand to refer to an specific, individual [Domain Name Server](/wiki/Domain_Name_Server) (that is "the DNS" rather than "the DNS server").

In November 2009 [I started](/blog/dns-changes) using [Nettica](/wiki/Nettica) as an external DNS provider for this site.
