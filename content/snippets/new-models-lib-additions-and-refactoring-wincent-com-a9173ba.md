title: New models, lib additions and refactoring (typechecked.net, a9173ba)
tags: snippets

This is the "disappear into a cave" and come out days later with a bunch of changes commit. I really would have liked to break this up into chunks but the changes are far too intermixed to make that very straighfoward.

So in this commit we have a host of new stuff: new CSS, more view templates, the "acts as sortable" module, a refactoring of the authentication module that makes it far more elegant, changes to the links model and controller, additional graphics, notes, the beginnings of a bayesian classifier, and some a "searchable" module (think "acts as ferret").

From here on will try to be more disciplined and break up the changes a little more!
