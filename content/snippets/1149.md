title: Involuntary reboot log 9.3 and 9.4
tags: involuntary.reboot.log snippets

Two [hard resets](/wiki/Hard_reset) due to macOS High Sierra and Active Directory not agreeing with one another: black screen, fans on, no prompt for password to decrypt volume. Even booted into recovery mode, APFS volume no longer accepts passphrase, requiring machine to be re-imaged (to Sierra, where it will stay, funnily enough).

This is still a great machine as far as hardware is concerned; chalking this one entirely up to the OS. This puts a dint in the great uptime numbers (was 217.5 days between failures, now 113.25 days) but they're still the best I've ever enjoyed on a Mac.
