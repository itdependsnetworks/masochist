Keyboard was jammed on waking from sleep, requiring a [hard reset](/wiki//wiki/Hard_reset). This time the repeating started about three characters into my passphrase. Note that this happened [even with Karabiner-Elements completely inactive](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/commit/5855025962dda75d461b50e8210b293587444832), so this is an OS-level flaw for sure. At this point, I'm going to say, "fuck it", and [disable the damn lockscreen](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/commit/5855025962dda75d461b50e8210b293587444832) so I at least have a way of recovering when this happens; when I am not using the machine and it is going to be out of my sight I'll need to power it down (ðŸ¤¦).
