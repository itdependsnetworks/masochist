title: Add tokenization of PRE_START and PRE_END (wikitext, 940a83b)
tags: snippets
---

As a convenience, it would be nice to offer the ability to use literal &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; tags to mark up PRE spans rather than just using the existing mechanism of prefixing each line with a space. This will be particularly useful when pasting in long code samples and the like.
