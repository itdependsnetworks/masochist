Reminder to Synergy customers: serial numbers are immediately sent via email by an automated system, so remember to check your junk mail folders if you are expecting a license notice but can't find it in your inbox. You can have your license resent to you at any time using [this link](https://typechecked.net/a/support/registration/), and you can get in touch with me via email.
