title: Whitespace cleanup (Synergy Advance, 8d99c8a)
tags: snippets
---

Another extensive whitespace cleanup of the entire tree; although not as many changes as in the WOCommon cleanup there are still over 12,000 lines in the diff. Cleanup consisted of: space-to-tab conversion for consistency where needed (in property lists); tab-to-space conversion for consistency where needed (source code etc); and removal of trailing whitespace.
