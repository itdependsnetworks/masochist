title: Add indentation specs (wikitext, bf79f03)
tags: snippets
---

Test user overrides of base indentation. The intention here is for incorporation in Haml templates (or any other templating system that takes care to produce beautifully-formatted HTML). The user can supply a base indentation level that matches the expected indentation level in the enclosing Haml template; in this way the wikitext-generated portion won't break the nice indentation of the template as a whole.
