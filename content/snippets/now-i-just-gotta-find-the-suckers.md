[Given two DFAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton 'Deterministic finite-state machine - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia') there are efficient algorithms to find a DFA recognizing the union, intersection, and complements of the languages they recognize. There are also efficient algorithms to determine whether a DFA accepts any strings, whether a DFA accepts all strings, whether two DFAs recognize the same language, and to find the DFA with a minimum number of states for a particular regular language.
