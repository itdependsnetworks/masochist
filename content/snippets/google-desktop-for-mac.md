[Google Desktop for Mac](http://desktop.google.com/mac/) is out, at least in beta form. Probably very interesting for Gmail users. I'm not a Gmailer myself, so I'll be sticking with [Spotlight](http://wincent.dev/wiki/Spotlight). We can all expect a much-improved [Spotlight](http://wincent.dev/wiki/Spotlight) experience in [Leopard](http://wincent.dev/wiki/Leopard) anyway.
