title: Translate Spanish text in Synergy Preferences nib into English (Synergy, cc76597)
tags: snippets

Leopard's Interface Builder has a new behaviour: when running on a non-English system new nibs are created in the current language rather than English. This true even when the development language is set to English and it's a deviation from the established behaviour in Tiger (and Panther, and Jaguar).

As a result some of the menu items in the 3.5a3 release were in Spanish when they should have been in English. This commit translates them into English.
