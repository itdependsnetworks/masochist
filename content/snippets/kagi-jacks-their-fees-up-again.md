Pretty much everything I [said here](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/10/kagi_a_recommen.php) is still true. [Kagi](https://wincent.dev/s/kagi/) offers fantastic service but for a very high fee; [this latest adjustment](http://www.kagi.com/resources/mm.php?page=11&year=2006) to their credit card fees cements their place as just about the most expensive payment processor in the marketplace.
