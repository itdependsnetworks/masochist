title: Fix custom rake database tasks (typechecked.net, 9e5a3d1)
tags: snippets

Here I was doing stuff like "db:reset:all" (which drops the databases, creates them, and then sets up the tables from the old schema.rb) when I really meant to do "db:migrate:reset:all" (which does the same, except recreates the tables by running all the migrations again).
