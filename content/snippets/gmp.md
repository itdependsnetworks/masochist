Doh. Can't get [GMP](http://www.swox.com/gmp/) to compile as a Universal Binary. Appears to compile fine for ppc using GCC 4.0.1, but I can't get it to compile at all for i386. This is a shame because it's preventing me from turning [WinHex](http://typechecked.net/a/products/winhex/) into a Universal Binary.
