title: Functional programming and Haskell

I once read somewhere that you should learn a new programming language every year to boost your mental agility. The last language I learnt was [Object-Oriented](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Object-Oriented) ([Ruby](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Ruby)). I've decided that the next one will be functional ([Haskell](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Haskell)). To that end I've just installed [Hugs 98](http://www.haskell.org/hugs/). As massively parallel multi-core computing becomes commonplace in the future I expect functional programming to get more and more popular.
