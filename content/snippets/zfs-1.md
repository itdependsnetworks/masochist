[Two](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2007/10/08/zfs/) [posts](http://drewthaler.blogspot.com/2007/10/don-be-zfs-hater.html) on [ZFS](http://wincent.dev/wiki/ZFS) worth linking to. [This one](http://www.macjournals.com/news/2007/10/04), on the other hand, isn't worth linking to at all, but I'm doing so because it serves as a contrast. Shame that this little piece of ill-informed trollery generated so much [exasperation](http://fukamachi.org/wp/2007/10/06/know-nothing-gruber-links-to-know-nothing-macjournal-annoyance-ensues/).
