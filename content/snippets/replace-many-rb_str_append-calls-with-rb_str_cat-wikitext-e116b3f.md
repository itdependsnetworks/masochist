title: Replace many rb_str_append calls with rb_str_cat (wikitext, e116b3f)
tags: snippets

I suspected that rb_str_cat would be faster than rb_str_append because it avoids an unnecessary object instantiation. This commit changes all constant strings to use rb_str_cat, shaving about 12% off of the parse time.
