title: Branching for Leopard

Given how [pleased I am with the Leopard API changes](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/09/leopard_api_cha.php), [created a new branch](http://wincent.dev/wiki/Creating_branches_with_Subversion) of Synergy and Synergy Advance so that I can start implementing Leopard-only features on the trunk.
