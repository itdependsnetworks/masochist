title: Snap window size to table view row height (REnamer, 97148f1)

When resizing, force window size to always coincide with the height of the rows in the table.

I've added the custom code for this into the WOHUDTableView class; if I ever want to extract that and make it a reusable class then this kind of custom code will need to be moved down into another subclass.
