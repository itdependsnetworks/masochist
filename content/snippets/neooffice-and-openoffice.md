[NeoOffice](http://neooffice.org/) 2.1 comes out (based on the OpenOffice 2.1 codebase) on 27 March; about three days later [OpenOffice 2.2](http://development.openoffice.org/releases/2.2.0.html) comes out.

NeoOffice is a fantastic boon to [Mac OS X](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/Mac%20OS%20X) users, but the lag can be a bit painful at times.
