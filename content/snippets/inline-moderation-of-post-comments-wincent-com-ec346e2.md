title: Inline moderation of post comments (typechecked.net, ec346e2)
tags: snippets
---

Add two buttons underneath each comment, but only when logged in as an admin user. The "spam" button marks a message as spam and then fades out the offending comment; the "ham" button clears the "awaiting moderation" attribute of the comment and fades out the "spam"/"ham" buttons.

At the top of the listing we show three comment counts: published comments, comments awaiting moderation, and spam comments. On the main listing page the comment count that we show is actually the sum of published comments and comments awaiting moderation.
