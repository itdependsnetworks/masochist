Just registered [wincent.co](http://wincent.co/) (redirecting to typechecked.net, obviously). Many is the time I've missed the final "m" on a dot-com domain. Everybody should have one. I find this curiously delightful, as I've always found the "Co" abbreviation for "Company" to be amusing; probably because of those old Warner Bros cartoons that I grew up with that so often featured "Acme Co". &lt;irony&gt;Will also be useful if I ever decide to open for business in Colombia&lt;/irony&gt;.
