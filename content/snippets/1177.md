Panic while the machine was unattended.

Despite this incident, the average time between failures for this machine is 170.6 days (up from 142), which is the best of any machine I've had since beginning to keep these records. (Technically, if I didn't have so many keyboard problems — most of which were caused by my decision to use Karabiner-Elements — with my mid-2015 MacBook Pro, that one would probably be the most reliable.)
