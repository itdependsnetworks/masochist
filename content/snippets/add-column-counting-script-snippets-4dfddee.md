title: Add column-counting script (snippets, 4dfddee)
tags: snippets

Simple Ruby script to print a histogram of line-width frequencies; its purpose is to get a feel for the typical line width in a code base which doesn't impose hard limits. It can also be used to check code bases which do have hard limits for violations.
