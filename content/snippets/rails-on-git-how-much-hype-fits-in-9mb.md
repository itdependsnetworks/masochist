title: Rails on Git: How much hype fits in 9MB?
tags: snippets
---

The _entire_ history of the [Rails](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Rails) repository occupies only 9MB when [imported into Git](http://www.sanityinc.com/articles/rails-on-git) (via [Michael Tsai's weblog](http://mjtsai.com/blog)). More good publicity for [Git](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Git) and some playfully snide remarks about Rails make for some pleasing reading.
