[Mailtrap](http://matt.blogs.it/entries/00002655.html) is a "fake" SMTP server that allows you to really send mails in your [Rails](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Rails) tests; it doesn't actually deliver the messages anywhere, but writes them to `/var/tmp/mailtrap.log` for your inspection. Not sure whether I'll use this but it's an interesting option.
