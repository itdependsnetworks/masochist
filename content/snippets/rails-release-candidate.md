The [first official release candidate is out](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2007/11/9/rails-2-0-release-candidate-1). Not upgrading just yet because I haven't even gotten a proper [Rails](http://wincent.com/wiki/Rails) development environment set up on [Leopard](http://wincent.com/wiki/Leopard) yet ([MySQL](http://wincent.com/wiki/MySQL) being the road-block there; haven't been able to build from source yet and I prefer to wait for the MySQL team's next release).
