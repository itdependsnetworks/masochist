Upgraded my Bugzilla install to 2.20.1. This software just gets better and better, although it bugs me that every time you run `checksetup.pl` it changes the access permissions on your files and you have to manually reset them so that your install will play nicely with [Apache's suEXEC](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/suexec.html).
