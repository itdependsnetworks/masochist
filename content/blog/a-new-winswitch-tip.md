title: A new WinSwitch tip
tags: blog
---

I was pleased to see that someone has posted [details](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20061212090013611) of how [WinSwitch](http://typechecked.net/a/products/winswitch/) can be used to make life easier when sharing iTunes or iPhoto libraries across multiple accounts.

I've added a link to [the hint](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20061212090013611) to the [WinSwitch FAQ page](http://typechecked.net/a/products/winswitch/faq/) where you can find out more information about WinSwitch's features.

If you find WinSwitch useful, please [donation](https://typechecked.net/a/products/winswitch/donate/) and help restore my faith in open source!
