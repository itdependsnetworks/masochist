The new [forums](/wiki/forums) are now online.

All the old posts have been imported, along with your user accounts. The one thing I couldn't migrate were the old passphrases. To choose a new passphrase, go to the [login](/wiki/login) page and click on the "Forgot your passphrase?" link. You enter your email address and you'll receive a special link that will enable you to choose a new passphrase.

If you no longer have access to the email address, let me know the old and new addresses and I'll set things up for you — that way you get to retain ownership of all your old posts and you won't have to create a new account — you can contact me via email (<example@example.com>) or by opening a [support ticket](/wiki/support_ticket).

The formatting on many of the posts isn't so great because the old system used a mixture of [UBBCode](/wiki/UBBCode) and [HTML](/wiki/HTML) while the new website uses [wikitext](/wiki/wikitext) markup for everything, but as the posts are mainly there for historical interest I am hoping this won't be too much of a problem.

The forum software itself is currently [beta](/wiki/beta) status, so if you discover any flaws please let me know.
