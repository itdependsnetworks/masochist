title: Improved Google search and AdSense
tags: blog

I've made some minor changes to the Google-powered [site search](http://typechecked.net/a/site-map/search/) today, namely, adding a Wincent logo and header to the search results:

I've also added some Google AdSense advertising to the Knowledge Base wiki. I don't plan to ever put advertising on the commercial parts of this site (the [product pages](http://typechecked.net/), for example) but I have no problems with adding a small amount of non-intrusive ads to a section like the Knowledge Base which is a free resource. I'm motivated principally by curiosity; I want to see how AdSense works from the side of the website operator. I suspect that on a site like this one that receives only modest traffic that the income will be insignificant, possibly even nil, but I'd still like to give it a try and see what happens.

You can read [this article](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Adding_Google_AdSense_to_MediaWiki) for more information on how to add AdSense to a MediaWiki installation.
