I've just released a new product — [atosym](http://typechecked.net/a/products/atosym/) — which is an address-to-symbol conversion aid for developers working with Apple's new dSYM debugging information file format.

It's free software released under a BSD license, downloadable in both source and executable forms, donations welcome.
