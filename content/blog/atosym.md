I've just released a new product — [atosym](http://wincent.com/a/products/atosym/) — which is an address-to-symbol conversion aid for developers working with Apple's new dSYM debugging information file format.

It's free software released under a BSD license, downloadable in both source and executable forms, [donations welcome](https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=win@wincent.com&item_name=atosym+donation&no_note=1&currency_code=EUR).
