Just saw [this post](http://www.zeldman.com/2007/09/27/something-new-at-apple-store/) (via [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/)):

> But while its beauty and usability have always run ahead of the pack, its underlying source code has not always kept pace. Now the online Apple Store’s inside is as beautiful as its exterior—and as far ahead of the mainstream in web development as a company like Apple needs to be.

Although [the store front](http://store.apple.com/) looks absolutely magnificent I am not so sure about the source. There is a _lot_ of superfluous whitespace which makes it much harder to read than it should be. [Tidy](http://wincent.com/wiki/Tidy) reports these warnings (but no hard errors):

Pipe it through `tidy -i` and it does look great, but without it I'm left feeling unsatisfied looking at the source. Maybe Apple needs to take some inspiration from [Haml](http://wincent.com/wiki/Haml).
