I'm pleased to announce the availability of the latest release in the [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy) stable 3.2 series (version 3.2.2). A full changelog appears [here](http://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.2.2).

You can download the new release from [the download page](http://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/download/) ([direct link](http://typechecked.net/download.php?item=SynergyJaguar.zip)) and purchase a license using [this page](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/).

# How does this release compare to the build given away with [MacHeist "Giving Tree" promotion](http://givingtree.macheist.com/)?

Both this release (3.2.2) and the MacHeist giveaway (labeled as version 3.3) derive from the same codebase. The only difference between them is that the MacHeist giveaway build does not require a serial number.
