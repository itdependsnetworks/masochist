[RSpec 1.0.0](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/RSpec%201.0.0) is out. This is a big deal because it means there is now a firm commitment to keeping the [API](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/API) stable, after a lot of changes in the lead-up to 1.0.0.

I just wish there was an [Objective-C](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/Objective-C) [Behaviour-Driven Development](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/Behaviour-Driven%20Development) framework like [RSpec](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/RSpec). Unfortunately, there never can be, because [RSpec](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/RSpec) works like it does only because of some features that are specific to [Ruby](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/Ruby) (such as everything being an object).

Maybe in Objective-C 3.0? I don't think so. The only way to make everything an object in Objective-C would be to drop the "[C](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/C)" part from it...
