Version 3.5.5a of [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy), the lightweight, highly-customizable [iTunes](/wiki/iTunes) controller is now available.

This is the latest release in the 3.5 alpha/experimental series. Until [Apple](/wiki/Apple) fixes the bugs in NSAppleScript running under Garbage Collection (see [bug \#640](/issues/640)) the 3.5 series may suffer from occasional crashes; in the meantime, the 3.4 stable series does not use Garbage Collection and so should be rock-solid.

This release offers a new menu item in the Synergy Global Menu for conveniently disabling/enabling last.fm "scrobbling" on the fly, a bug fix for scrobbling of consecutively repeated tracks, and a slimmer disk footprint.

Please note, this release, like the last one, **_has a minimum system version requirement of Mac OS X 10.5.8_**; if you run an older version of [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) you can use the 3.4 stable series, which runs on all versions of Mac OS X right back to 10.2.8.

A full changelog appears [here](http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.5.5a).

You can download the new release from [the download page](http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/download/) ([direct link](http://wincent.com/download.php?item=SynergyBeta.zip)) and purchase a license using [this page](https://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/). Please note that 3.5.4a is not a free update for users who received a free copy of Synergy as part of the MacHeist Giving Tree bundle (see the [MacHeist FAQ](/blog/frequently-asked-questions-about-synergy-and-macheist) for more information).

Also of note was the release of 3.4 (stable series) at the end of June. If you're curious about the difference between the two series and would like to know which one you should use, please see my [blog](/blog) post, "[Clearing up confusion about Synergy version numbers](/blog/clearing-up-confusion-about-synergy-version-numbers)".
