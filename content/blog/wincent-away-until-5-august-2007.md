title: Wincent away until 5 August 2007
tags: blog

This week I'll be departing for a short vacation and will have limited or no access to email while away. I'm not sure of the actual departure date just yet but it's likely to be Wednesday, 1 August 2007. I'll be returning late on Sunday, 5 August 2007.

In the meantime, please use the online support resources that are available to you 24 hours per day:

-   [Support forums](http://wincent.com/a/support/forums/)
-   [Bug tracking and feature requests database](http://wincent.com/a/support/bugs/)
-   [Product information pages](http://wincent.com/a/products/)

Please take care to supply the correct email address when purchasing products and if using PayPal make sure your account settings are up to date. Licenses are issued immediately by automated systems, so all you'll have to do is make sure that you provide a working email address and you will receive your license even though I'm out of town. You may also wish to make sure that your spam filters don't mistakenly eat any such messages, and if you have a challenge-response anti-spam system you'll need to turn that off or manually override it (the license issuing system ignores such challenges). For reference, licenses are sent from <example@example.com>, so you might want to white-list that address.

Thanks for your patience. I hope to get on top of any email backlog within 24 hours of getting back.
