title: Email response times: back to normal
tags: blog

Just over a month ago I [advised](http://wincent.dev/a/news/archives/2006/05/email_response.php) that I was switching ISPs and that the lack of net access would affect my email response times.

Today the new provider finally came online, so response times should be back to normal. I have a couple of product updates and new releases up my sleeve that I've been holding back due to the lack of access, but now that access is restored you can expect to see more activity here during the coming weeks.
