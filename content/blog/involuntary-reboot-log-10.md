### Involuntary reboot stats to date

-   **Operating system version:** undisclosed
-   **Kernel panics:** 6
-   **Hard resets:** 4
-   **Total failures:** 10

As per usual I used the interactive Ruby interpreter, `irb`, to do the date calculations for me:

    require 'date'
    Date.today - Date.new(2006, 5, 21)
    342 / 10
