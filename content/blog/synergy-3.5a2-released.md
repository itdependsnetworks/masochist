Some users were unable to install the Synergy 3.5a release made available a [couple of hours ago](http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2007/11/synergy_35a_rel.php). If you are one of these users, please download the [updated version](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.5a2) (3.5a2) which is now on the servers.

You can download the updated release [from here](http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=SynergyBeta.dmg) and purchase a license using [this page](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/). The 3.2-series can still be downloaded [from here](http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=SynergyJaguar.dmg). This is a free upgrade for users who already hold a valid Synergy license.
