The forums are now back online again, now on the new server. All of the members, threads and posts have been transferred across from the old server. The bug and feature requests database is also online -- in fact it was one of the first things to go back into service -- and the new, improved mailing lists page is up (although there are still a few more lists to be added to it). There are still a few pages to be updated but pretty much everything seems to have come across smoothly. I will try to transfer the subscribers from the old lists but if I am unable to do so I will post an announcement here advising people of the need to resubscribe.
