Synergy 2.3 has just been released. This release fixes all remaining issues that were reported during the testing period; as a result Synergy is now a fully-fledged Universal Binary that will run identically (and natively) on both the Intel and PowerPC platforms. A full changelog appears [here](http://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/history/).

You can download the new release [from here](http://typechecked.net/download.php?item=Synergy.dmg) or purchase a license using [this page](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/). Wincent is making Universal Binary versions of all Wincent products available for free to registered users, but if you'd like to support Wincent's ongoing development efforts and help to recoup the significant developer costs of the transition to Intel, please consider [making a donation](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/donate/) or [buying a license](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-advance/purchase/) for the upcoming product, Synergy Advance.
