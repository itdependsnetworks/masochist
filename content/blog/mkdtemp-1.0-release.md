title: mkdtemp 1.0 release
tags: mkdtemp blog

mkdtemp is a tiny little [RubyGem](/wiki/RubyGem) that I use whenever I need to securely create temporary files or directories in [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby). I've used it several times over the years, and the source code has been publicly available for some time, but it's only now that I've actually published it as a gem for the first time.

From the docs, mkdtemp:

> securely creates temporary directories. It is a wrapper for the mkdtemp() function in the standard C library.
