I'm pleased to announce the release of version 0.6 of the [Command-T](/wiki/Command-T) plug-in for [VIM](/wiki/VIM). This is a powerful, [open source](/wiki/open_source) file-navigation plug-in inspired by the "Command-T" feature in [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate).

This is a minor feature release that adds the ability to provide an optional starting path to the `:CommandT` command. So in other words, you can be anchored in a project but still quickly open files from a project in another directory if you need to. See feature [request \#1522](/issues/1522) for more information.

Incidentally, as the basic functionality is now solidly in place, and with a number of successful releases under its belt it seems that most issues with compatibility on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux are sorted out, so the next release is likely to be 1.0.

So, if you're a [VIM](/wiki/VIM) user check out the [screencasts](/products/command-t) and give the plug-in a try. If you'd like to support development you can use [the donations page](/products/command-t/donations) to make a donation, or consider submitting a patch for the project.
