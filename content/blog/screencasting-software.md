Since posting [my first screencast](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/04/noncontiguous_s.php) yesterday I've received a couple of emails asking about the software used to make it.

[iShowU](http://wincent.com/wiki/iShowU) is used for capture. I already held a license for the standard version of [Snapz Pro X](http://wincent.com/wiki/Snapz%20Pro%20X), and normally I would lean towards it because it is the product with the more established reputation _but_ after trialling [iShowU](http://wincent.com/wiki/iShowU) for just 5 minutes I decided it was the one for me. It costs US$20 (compared with US$40 for the [Snapz Pro X](http://wincent.com/wiki/Snapz%20Pro%20X) upgrade) and has a large number of features and preferences that make it ideal for screencasting; I'm sure that you'll feel the same if you give it a try.

[KeyCastr](http://wincent.com/wiki/KeyCastr) is used to show what keys are being pressed on the keyboard. It too is highly customizable and once again there's no competition. It's freeware.

[OmniDazzle](http://wincent.com/wiki/OmniDazzle) is used to highlight the location of the pointer.

These tools are ideal for throwing together a quick-and-dirty screencast like yesterday's; that is one where you want to just to do one take and record live audio as you go. For lengthier, more polished screencasts I think you'll have to do multiple takes, record the audio separately (almost definitely with a microphone other than the built-in one that came with your Mac), and put it all together in Final Cut Pro as [described here](http://rentzsch.com/notes/screencastingWithSnapzProAndFinalCutPro).

I found out about most of these tools from watching the screencasts provided by [Railscasts](http://www.railscasts.com). They have very high production values and are well worth checking out if you want to learn about [Ruby on Rails](http://wincent.com/wiki/Ruby%20on%20Rails).
