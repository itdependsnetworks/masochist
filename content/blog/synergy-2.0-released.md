A new version of [Synergy](http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/) ([2.0](http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#2.0)) is now available on the servers. This is a maintenance release. A [few issues](http://wincent.dev/a/news/archives/2005/06/synergy_and_syn.php) outside of my control delayed this release a little bit but things are now getting back to normal. I hope to resume a stable monthly pattern of updates from here on.
