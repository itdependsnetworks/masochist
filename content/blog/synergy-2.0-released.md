A new version of [Synergy](http://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/) ([2.0](http://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#2.0)) is now available on the servers. This is a maintenance release. A [few issues](http://typechecked.net/a/news/archives/2005/06/synergy_and_syn.php) outside of my control delayed this release a little bit but things are now getting back to normal. I hope to resume a stable monthly pattern of updates from here on. [Download](http://typechecked.net/download.php?item=Synergy.dmg), [purchase](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/) or [donate](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/donate/) here, and [retrieve your lost license codes here](https://typechecked.net/a/support/registration/).
