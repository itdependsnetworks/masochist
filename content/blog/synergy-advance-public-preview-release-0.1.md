The first public preview release of Synergy Advance is now on the servers. You can download it [here](http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/download/). Please see the [road map](http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/road-map/) and the [known issues](http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/known-issues/). If you discover any bugs please file a report (see the bug reporting guidelines [here](http://wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2004/11/how_to_file_a_g.php) and the instructions for beta testers [here](http://wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2005/04/information_for.php)).

This release is the core application. I was hoping to ship more modules with the first preview, but I ran into a few Cocoa problems in the second half of this month that ending up eating several days each when I had planned to spend only a single day on each item. So I'll be following this release up with another preview soon.
