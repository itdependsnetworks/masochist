I've just set up a couple of [Git](/wiki/Git) repository mirrors for my [open source](/wiki/open_source) projects.

The _authoritative, official_ repositories continue to be hosted at git.wincent.dev.

But now there are _mirror, backup_ repositories hosted at:

-   <http://gitorious.org/~wincent>; and
-   <http://github.com/wincent/>

Changes are automatically pushed out from the authoritative repo to the backup/mirror repos on an hourly basis.

The sheer flexibility of [distributed version control](/wiki/distributed_version_control), and the ability to trivially set up mirrors like this, is really fantastic.

For the curious, here are some notes I made on the process:

-   [Setting up backup (mirror) repositories on Gitorious](/wiki/Setting_up_backup_%28mirror%29_repositories_on_Gitorious)
