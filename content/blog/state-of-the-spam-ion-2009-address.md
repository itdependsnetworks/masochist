title: State of the Spam-ion 2009 Address

Over the last few years I have posted periodic updates on the amount of spam that I receive, to satisfy my curiosity about whether the trend is upwards, and how much so.

Well, the verdict is in, and the problem is indeed continuing to get worse.

## Observations

-   The number of spam messages per day has really shot up since the last report (from 74 per day to 235 per day).
-   Spam now accounts for 53% of all mail I receive (up from 24% and bringing me in line with the average for the Internet as a whole).
-   [SpamSieve](/wiki/SpamSieve) is gradually getting more accurate (99.8% correct, up from 99.6% correct last time) and the number of detected false positives since data collection began (nearly 5 years ago) is still a very respectable 284.

In reality, although the problem is getting much worse, I find myself spending less time looking at spam now than ever. I think this is mostly because I am trusting tools like SpamSieve now to do the right thing; but I _am_ sure that there are definitely some legitimate messages getting lost along the way, drowned out by the ever-growing avalanche of spam.
