title: Leopard update
tags: blog

I've just learned that [Apple](http://wincent.dev/wiki/Apple) has made the final release of [Leopard](http://wincent.dev/wiki/Leopard) available to developers (via download) several weeks earlier than expected (in the case of Tiger they didn't make a download available and developers had to wait for mailed copies).

As a result, I'll soon be delivering updates to my products including changes for compatibility with the final version of Leopard, and I'll be able to get started on final testing considerably sooner than expected.
