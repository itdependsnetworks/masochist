title: Bugzilla 3.0 improvements
tags: blog
---

As I [mentioned](http://typechecked.net/a/about/wincent/weblog/mini-log/archives/2007/01/bugzilla_30.php) in the [Mini-log](http://typechecked.net/a/about/wincent/weblog/mini-log/archives/), Bugzilla 3.0 has some [really nice improvements](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=upgrade-2006-12-26.html) in store.

Favorite changes:

-   Textareas zoom larger when you click in them (optional).
-   You can change the resolution of a bug without re-opening it (long overdue).
-   You can add an attachment when creating a new bug report.
-   Navigation links in the header.
-   Pages are much cleaner now because bugs are only editable when you're logged in.
-   Improved layout of the "show bug" page.
-   UTF-8 encoding used throughout.
-   Quoted text in bugs is now displayed in a different color.
-   Real names shown instead of email addresses.
-   Can mark bugs as ASSIGNED at the time of filing them.

Nothing earth-shattering but lots of minor interface and usability improvements, and many of these little changes are things which would otherwise get in the way of my workflow every single day. It's good to see these changes as Bugzilla is a bit of a slow-moving beast; I get the impression that it's not quite as easy to work on as similar products built using a "rapid web application development framework" like Rails. I welcome any improvements that the Bugzilla team makes to make the product more user-friendly.

[bugzilla.mozilla.org](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) has been upgraded to the still in-development 3.0 code, so a final release is definitely getting closer.
