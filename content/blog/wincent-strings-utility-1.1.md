title: Wincent Strings Utility 1.1
tags: blog
---

I've just released an update to [Wincent Strings Utility](http://wincent.dev/a/products/wincent-strings-util/). New in version 1.1 is automated `InfoPlist.strings` preprocessing and numerous bug fixes. This is also the first version to be released under the GPL (with the permission of Omni Development; Wincent Strings Utility is a derivative of the Omni `stringsUtil`).

It's free software released under a GPL license, downloadable in both source and executable forms, donations welcome.
