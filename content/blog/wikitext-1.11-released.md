title: Wikitext 1.11 released
tags: releases wikitext blog
---

A new version of the [Wikitext](/wiki/Wikitext) gem, version 1.11, is now available. This is a maintenance release which includes a number of internal tweaks and cleanups in preparation for the imminent Rails 3 final release. This is still preliminary work, however, and it is almost certain that more changes will be required and will follow in a subsequent Wikitext update.

[Wikitext](/wiki/Wikitext) is a fast wikitext-to-[HTML](/wiki/HTML) translator with a syntax very close to that used by [MediaWiki](/wiki/MediaWiki). It is a [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) extension written with speed and robustness in mind using a [Ragel](/wiki/Ragel)-generated scanner and an extremely fast hand-coded parser, all in [C](/wiki/C). It has an enormous spec suite.

You can browse the source code repo, or download the [gem](/wiki/gem) from the [rubygems.org downloads page](http://rubygems.org/gems/wikitext). For an overview of how to use the extension check out the [RDoc](/wiki/RDoc) [here](http://wikitext.rubyforge.org/). If you have [RubyGems](/wiki/RubyGems) then you can install it with either `gem install wikitext` or `sudo gem install wikitext`.

If you find the extension useful please consider making a donation via PayPal.
