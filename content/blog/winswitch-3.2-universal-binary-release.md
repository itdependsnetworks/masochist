title: WinSwitch 3.2 (Universal Binary) release
tags: blog
---

[WinSwitch](http://wincent.dev/a/products/winswitch/) version 3.2 is now available for download. All reported issues with the previous beta release have been addressed, as well as other improvements (see [the full change history](http://wincent.dev/a/products/winswitch/history/)). This release offers native compatibility with both PowerPC and Intel processors ("Universal Binary").

WinSwitch is freeware but I depend on donations to cover the costs of distribution and development, so please consider [making a contribution](https://wincent.dev/a/products/winswitch/donate/). The download-to-donation ratio is well over 1,000 to 1, so please think about helping out. If the ratio does not improve this may be the last ever WinSwitch release.

If you haven't used WinSwitch before [take a look at the screenshots](http://wincent.dev/a/products/winswitch/screenshots/) or head over to the [downloads page](http://wincent.dev/a/products/winswitch/download/) and take it for a spin!
