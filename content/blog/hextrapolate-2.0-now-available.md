Following a [successful beta testing period](http://typechecked.net/a/news/archives/2007/04/hextrapolate_20.php) the new version of Hextrapolate (formerly WinHex), 2.0, is now available.

This is a ground-up rewrite of the original WinHex number conversion utility with many new features, bug fixes and enhancements. This is also the first Universal Binary release for Hextrapolate. See the [full changelog](http://typechecked.net/a/products/hextrapolate/history/) for all the details. The name-change took place to avoid confusion with a Windows product of the same name.

Hextrapolate licenses can be purchased [here](https://typechecked.net/a/products/hextrapolate/purchase/), and you can download the product [here](http://typechecked.net/a/products/hextrapolate/download/).
