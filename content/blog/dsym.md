Now that I've got [`atosym`](http://typechecked.net/a/products/atosym/) I will be using DWARF debugging information format across all my products. The key missing piece of the puzzle was realizing that Xcode creates dSYM files using `dsymutil(1)`; so instead of letting Xcode handle it I can do it manually, thus avoiding problems with Xcode trying to create dSYM files on already-stripped executables. The first project to be switched over is WOTest. Next: the new app.
