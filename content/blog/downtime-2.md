> We have important news about your account. EC2 has detected degradation of the underlying hardware hosting one or more of your Amazon EC2 instances in the us-east-1 region. Due to this degradation, your instance(s) could already be unreachable. Running instances will be stopped or terminated after 12:00AM UTC on 2015-09-10.

I saw this email from Amazon earlier today — about 7 hours ago — and didn't think it critical. But then, an hour or so ago I noticed that typechecked.net actually was down, and in fact had been for about 8 hours.

New instance now up, configured painlessly by drones I mean [Ansible](/wiki/Ansible).
