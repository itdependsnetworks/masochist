The new version of [Synergy](http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/), 3.1, is now in beta testing.

The principal new feature in this release is [integrated Audioscrobbler (last.fm) support](http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/features/audioscrobbler/), as well as extensive revisions and optimization of the codebase (see [the full changelog](http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.1b) for more details).

In the meantime, the previous stable release, [version 3.0](http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.0), continues to be available for [download](http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/download/) and [purchase](https://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/). Within the next two weeks, an updated beta or a final version of 3.1 will be made available.
