title: Internal encoding conversion benchmarks
tags: blog

[Ruby](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Ruby) has a (somewhat justified) reputation for being slow but one of the great things about it is that it is easy to write extensions for it in lightening-fast [C](http://typechecked.net/wiki/C). Despite the fact that for some time now C has been "the new assembly", extensions written in C integrate remarkably well with Ruby's pure garbage-collected, object-oriented goodness.

I am working on [Rails](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Rails) application at the moment and pretty much _all_ the textual content is going to be entered and stored as [wikitext](http://typechecked.net/wiki/wikitext), my favorite free-form markup. I could do the parsing in Ruby but I want this to be _fast_, so I didn't even bother prototyping it in Ruby first: I dived straight into C from the beginning, using an [ANTLR](http://typechecked.net/wiki/ANTLR)-generated lexer (using the C target) and a custom parser/transformer on top of that in hand-coded C.

The core (Java) target of ANTLR itself uses UTF-16 but the C target uses UTF-16's obsolete half-brother, UCS-2. Actually, it apparently uses UTF-32 under the covers but the interface it exposes works with UCS-2. The problem with UCS-2 is that it can't represent all Unicode characters, only a subset of them, because it doesn't have a surrogate mechanism like UTF-16 does. For precisely this reason it is easier to deal with because you have a guarantee that all characters are exactly 16 bits, but it sucks because it means that there are some valid Unicode input strings that you can't convert to UCS-2, which in turn means that your ANTLR-generated C recognizer won't be able to process them. UTF-32 doesn't have this problem because it is both fixed width _and_ large enough to represent all of the Unicode codepoints, but the down side is that it takes up a little more space (probably not much of an issue with a wikitext parser, where most slabs of input text aren't ever going to occupy more than a few KB). In any case once the ANTLR C target's [API](http://typechecked.net/wiki/API) settles down into something stable I'll consider making the switch to UTF-32 if it doesn't require too much work (or I'll just throw the whole ANTLR thing out the window and write a scanner using [Ragel](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Ragel)).

But I digress. I wanted to talk about benchmarking.

All that stuff about ANTLR was just to background to explain that in my wikitext parser I have to convert from the input encoding (UTF-8) to UCS-2 for internal processing purposes. Then at the end I convert back to UTF-8 and return the results.

I initially did this with the [iconv](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/iconv/rdoc/index.html) module that comes with the Ruby standard library. Then, seeing as it is relatively simple to convert back and forth between UCS-2 and UTF-8 I decided to write some internal conversion methods in pure C, thus eliminating the dependency on iconv and hopefully being faster to boot. If I ever move to UTF-32 the methods will be easily extended.

So I just did some benchmarking to compare the results. I basically converted in both directions with both implementations (the custom internal one and the iconv one), and I tried with four different classes of input: short strings with only ASCII characters in them, short strings with non-ASCII characters, big slabs with only ASCII characters, and big slabs with non-ASCII characters.

Each line in the following tables shows the time taken for 100,000 iterations; the first batch are from the "rehearsal" run and then there's the "real thing":

I was pleasantly surprised at the speed-up. As far as I know, the Ruby Iconv module is just a wrapper for the iconv library (which is written in C, I believe), so I wouldn't expect it to be so slow. And there are no clever optimization tricks in my implementation or shortcuts; it's basically written based on the information [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16/UCS-2).

Observations:

-   For short strings the internal implementation is about 4 to 5 times faster
-   For longer strings the gap widens to as much as 7 times faster
-   Unsuprisingly, for both implementations processing input in the ASCII range is faster
-   Slightly more interestingly, for the internal implementation converting _to_ UCS-2 is faster than converting _from_ it; the fluctuations in the case of the iconv implemenation aren't as clear
