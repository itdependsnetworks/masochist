Just found [this page](http://www.railshosting.org/#right_plan_for_you), and the interesting thing about it is how many hits per day you can expect to be able to serve with your new [Rails](http://typechecked.net/wiki/Rails) app, depending on your hosting plan. I know it's only one data point, but according to this page you need to start thinking about dedicated servers with as little as 2,000 to 5,000 measly hits per day. Incredible. That's spectacularly bad. For 5,000 and up you are in dedicated server territory, possibly even dedicated _servers_.

I've never deployed a Rails app in the wild yet. Would be interested to [hear from](mailto:example@example.com) people who have contrasting or confirming numbers.
