Version 4.3b of [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy), the lightweight, highly-customizable [iTunes](/wiki/iTunes) controller, has just been released. The 4.0 series is a brand new line of development especially for [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) 10.6 [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard).

This is a minor feature release which adds the ability to directly launch Synergy by pressing and holding the Option key while double-clicking on the Synergy Preferences application (normally you would open the preferences and click the "Start" button).

Note that the 4.0 series will _only_ run on [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard). (Version 3.4.1, the last release in the stable series will run on all versions of Mac OS X from 10.2.8 upwards.) A full changelog appears [here](/products/synergy/history).

For many users this release will be a free upgrade: see [this blog post](/blog/synergy-4.0-upgrades) to find out whether you qualify. If you got Synergy through the MacHeist Giving Tree bundle see [the MacHeist FAQ](/blog/frequently-asked-questions-about-synergy-and-macheist).

The [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy) product pages were recently completely revamped for 4.0, so be sure to [check them out](/products/synergy).
