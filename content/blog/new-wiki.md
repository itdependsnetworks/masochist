The new [wiki](/wiki/wiki) is the first part of the updated site that's ready for action. All — well, _almost_ all — of the content has been migrated across from the wiki on the old server. You can view it by clicking the "Wiki" link in the navigation bar that you see across the top of every page.

If you compare any given page on the static mirror with the corresponding page in the new [wiki](/wiki/wiki) you'll see that the export/import worked fairly well. Here's an example article selected at random:

-   New: [Upgrading to Bugzilla 3.0.1](/wiki/Upgrading_to_Bugzilla_3.0.1)

This is largely due to the fact that the [wikitext](/wiki/wikitext) markup used by the new [website](/wiki/website) is almost identical to that used by [MediaWiki](/wiki/MediaWiki). There _are_ some minor glitches on some of the pages and the old MediaWiki categories don't always translate very well into "[Web 2.0](/wiki/Web_2.0)"-style [tags](/wiki/tags), but on the whole the [wiki](/wiki/wiki) migration went very well. If you spot a problem with an article please let me know at <win@wincent.com> and I'll get it sorted out.
