I just released version 1.11 of [Command-T](/wiki/Command-T). Command-T is a powerful, [open source](/wiki/open_source) file and buffer-navigation plug-in inspired by the "Command-T" feature in [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate).

# What's new

This release is a mixture of performance improvements, bug fixes and small features. Highlights are the fast new "git" file scanner which uses `git ls-files` instead of scanning the file-system (patch from Patrick Hayes), and a new `'g:CommandTTraverseSCM'` setting which causes Command-T to start its search from the nearest SCM directory (based on patches from David Szotten and Ben Osheroff).

As always, a full change-log appears under HISTORY in the documentation, and you can explore the commits in the release [here](/repos/command-t/tags/1.11). (Note: the integrated repository browser that I'm linking to here is still relatively new and doesn't have a full feature set yet. You may prefer to view the commits [on GitHub](https://github.com/wincent/Command-T/compare/1.10...1.11).)

# Installation

Command-T is a combination of C, Ruby and Vim's built-in scripting language, which means that you need not only Ruby and a suitable C compiler on your system, but you also have to make sure you use compatible versions. That is, you can't link your Vim against Ruby 1.9.3 and Command-T against Ruby 2.1.2 without things going "Boom!". It can be hard to install. Please see the documentation for trouble-shooting hints.
