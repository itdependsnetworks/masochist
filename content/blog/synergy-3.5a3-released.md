I'm very pleased to announce the availability of version 3.5a3 of Synergy, the third alpha release in the brand new 3.5 series. The last release, version 3.2, was [Leopard](http://wincent.dev/wiki/Leopard)-compatible but would also run on all versions of [Mac OS X](http://wincent.dev/wiki/Mac%20OS%20X) from [Jaguar](http://wincent.dev/wiki/Jaguar) onwards.

The 3.5 series, on the other hand, is a total rewrite in Objective-C 2.0 which will run _only_ on Leopard and as such it is somewhat experimental in nature. If you want stability then I recommend that you stick with 3.2 for now, but if you like to live on the edge and see the latest then by all means try out the 3.5 series. This new alpha fixes a large number of issues reported for the previous alpha and should prove to be much more polished. There are still some minor issues being investigated, but this is now much closer to what the final 3.5 release will look like.

A full changelog appears [here](http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.5a3).

You can download the new release [from here](http://wincent.dev/download.php?item=SynergyBeta.zip) and purchase a license using [this page](https://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/). The 3.2 series can still be downloaded [from here](http://wincent.dev/download.php?item=SynergyJaguar.dmg). Once the 3.5 series goes final it will be a free upgrade to all users who have purchased a license for Synergy 3.0 or higher (that is, if you purchased on or after 5 September 2006 then 3.5 will be a free upgrade for you).
