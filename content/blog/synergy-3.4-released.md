I'm pleased to announce the availability of the latest release in the [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy) stable series (version 3.4). Synergy is a lightweight, customizable and reliable [iTunes](/wiki/iTunes) controller.

A full changelog appears [here](http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.4).

You can download the new release from [the download page](http://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/download/) ([direct link](http://wincent.dev/download.php?item=SynergyJaguar.zip)) and purchase a license using [this page](https://wincent.dev/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/). Please note that 3.4 is not a free update for users who received a free copy of Synergy as part of the MacHeist Giving Tree bundle.

I'll be following this up with a release in the experimental alpha (3.5) series shortly.
