Release candidate 2 for Synergy 2.3 has just been released. The new candidate fixes a problem with license code validation on the Intel platform caused by byte-ordering issues. A full changelog appears [here](http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/history/).

The release has already been seeded to beta testers. If you wish to participate in the testing effort you can download the release candidate [from here](http://wincent.com/download.php?item=Synergy2.3.dmg) and report any bugs or issues that you might find. The current, stable release (version 2.2) continues to be available for download [from here](http://wincent.com/download.php?item=Synergy.dmg).
