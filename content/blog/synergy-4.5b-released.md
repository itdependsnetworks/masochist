Version 4.5b of [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy), the lightweight, highly-customizable [iTunes](/wiki/iTunes) controller, has just been released for beta testing. The 4.0 series is a brand new line of development especially for [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) 10.6 [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard).

This is the first "code signed" release of Synergy, which means that when Synergy posts updates to Last.fm and the system asks for permission to access the Mac OS X keychain, clicking "Always Allow" will actually grant access on a permanent basis (previously, using each new Synergy release would cause the system to ask for permission again).

Note that the 4.0 series will _only_ run on [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard). (Version 3.4.1, the last release in the stable series will run on all versions of Mac OS X from 10.2.8 upwards.) A full changelog appears [here](/products/synergy/history).

For many users this release will be a free upgrade: see [this blog post](/blog/synergy-4.0-upgrades) to find out whether you qualify. If you got Synergy through the MacHeist Giving Tree bundle see [the MacHeist FAQ](/blog/frequently-asked-questions-about-synergy-and-macheist).

The [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy) product pages were recently completely revamped for 4.0, so be sure to [check them out](/products/synergy).

You can download the new release from [the download page](/products/synergy/download) and purchase a license using [this page](https://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/).
