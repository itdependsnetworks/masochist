Synergy Advance version 0.4 beta has just been released to beta testers. [Purchase](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-advance/purchase/), [donate](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-advance/purchase/), [sponsor](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-advance/purchase/), read the [changelog](http://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-advance/history/), or [download](http://typechecked.net/download.php?item=SynergyAdvance0.4b.dmg) (2.9MB).

Note that this is a limited seed release and that nondisclosure (confidentiality) provisions apply. The build is not for public discussion or redistribution, but membership in the beta program is open to anyone who is interested. I am also happy to provide a complimentary Synergy license on request to any beta tester that [purchases a Synergy Advance license](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-advance/purchase/).
