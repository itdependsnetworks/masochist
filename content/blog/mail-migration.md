I'm currently migrating mail hosts. If you were expecting to hear from me but haven't yet, please drop me a line at <example@example.com>.

At this point, human-generated email should be up and running fine. I'm going through the automated systems (things like lost serial number emails, license purchases etc) now making sure that all glitches are ironed out. Please contact me if you didn't receive a reply — automated or otherwise — that you were expecting.

\[**Update:** I've gone through an audited all the automated email systems; I believe everything should be working now.\]
