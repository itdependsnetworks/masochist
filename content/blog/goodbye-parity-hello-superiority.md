Goodbye [parity](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/another_perform.php), hello superiority. The thing which finally pushed us over the hump wasn't increasing the complexity of the grammar or the size of the input text, but increasing the complexity of the parsing operation itself; I'm now storing much richer information in the parse results which enable better error reporting and some other fancy stuff. The "fancy stuff" are basically compiler-level tricks that are made possible when your AST contains more information that helps individual nodes to know "where" they are in the original source file.
