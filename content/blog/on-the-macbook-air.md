title: On the MacBook Air

I admit to not being really excited about this year's keynote. I've been so engrossed with work of late that I didn't even know what day the keynote would take place. And I knew that most of the things that would be talked about wouldn't excite me: Apple TV (don't have a TV), iPhone stuff (you can't buy iPhones in the country where I live yet), iTunes movie rentals (I don't like the rental model, I'd rather own stuff). Furthermore, the machines which most interest me, [the Mac Pros](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2008/01/the_new_mac_pro.php), were already revamped before the show started.

But I must confess, even though I am not in the market to buy any new Apple product right now, I am _really_ impressed with the new [MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/). If I were to buy a laptop, this would be the one for me. I am not one of those people who wants their laptop to be their only machine; for these people the Air is not the right product. I'm a person who wants a portable to be portable; so for me the decision to leave out the optical drive is a very clever optimization. Ever since Apple dropped a 12" model from their line-up I've felt it was a gap. I still have my 12" PowerBook G4 (the aluminum one). It was a great machine and has never skipped a beat in all these years (over four years now, eons in computer time).

So if I were to buy a laptop, the Air would be the one. The most portable portable ever!
