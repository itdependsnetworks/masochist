I'm pleased to announce the release of a new version of Bansshee, the lightweight daemon written in [Perl](/wiki/Perl) for defending against brute-force/dictionary attacks on [SSH](/wiki/SSH) servers.

This release adds support files for [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux) 5.3, and a license change from the [GPL](/wiki/GPL) to the more permissive [BSD](/wiki/BSD) license.

If you find the software useful, please consider making a [donation](http://wincent.dev/a/products/bansshee/#donations).
