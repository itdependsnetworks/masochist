The new version of [Synergy](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/), 3.1.5, is now in beta testing.

This is principally a compatibility release intended to prepare Synergy for [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/Leopard) (see [the full changelog](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.1.5b) for more details); if you have access to the Leopard seeds please focus your testing efforts on that platform.

In the meantime, the previous stable release, [version 3.1.4](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.1.4), continues to be available for [download](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/download/) and [purchase](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/) for only 5â‚¬.
