By far the most common typo I make while trying to get to `wincent.com` is `wincent.co`. I'd love to have it as a domain name, not only because of the number of mistakes I make, but because I think it sounds cool.

[Dot-co](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.co) is the country-level [TLD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) for Colombia. There was some talk of opening it up to external registrations but apparently they decided to go against it. Even if they do open things up one day, I expect it would likely be too expensive to warrant picking it up.
