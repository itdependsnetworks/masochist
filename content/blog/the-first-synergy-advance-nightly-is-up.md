title: The first Synergy Advance nightly is up...
tags: blog
---

Still plenty to be fixed as [noted in the announcement](http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2007/04/synergy_advance_9.php)... but I think I have to do something about my build times:

    START: Wed Apr 04 06:10:41 +0200 2007
    PROJECT: synergy_jaguar

So Synergy gets skipped because there have been no changes committed since [the last nightly](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/archives/2007/03/synergy_revision_340.php) was uploaded; 21 lines logged later...

    SKIPPING: revision 340 already uploaded for this project
    PROJECT: synergy_advance

37952 lines logged and about 17 minutes later...

    STDOUT: ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
    UPLOAD: /tmp/SynergyAdvance-20070404061046/build/Release/SynergyAdvanceNightly(429).dmg
    COMMAND: scp -q /tmp/SynergyAdvance-20070404061046/build/Release/SynergyAdvanceNightly(429).dmg
