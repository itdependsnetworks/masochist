title: Leopard product readiness
tags: blog

With [Leopard](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/Leopard) only 15 hours from release it's time for a product status report:

### Leopard-ready

The following products have received extensive testing on pre-release versions of Leopard and are expected to work with a high degree of compatibility. When Apple ships the final version to developers further testing will be performed to see if any further changes are required:

-   Synergy: the lightweight, robust, and feature-packed iTunes controller.
-   Install: simple and dependable installation solution for developers.
-   WOTest: open source Objective-C unit testing framework.
-   Wincent Strings Utility: open source localization helper tool for developers.

### Beta-status

This product hasn't been heavily tested with Leopard but conflicting reports have been received that it continues to work under the new operating system; others report that they've been unable to install it. When the Leopard final arrives further investigation will be undertaken.

-   WinSwitch: Fast User Switching menu replacement.

### Coming soon

These products aren't yet Leopard-ready but work is well on the way to completion (about 90% done) and so I hope to release Leopard-compatible versions within the next two to three weeks:

-   Synergy Advance: Plug-in based audio companion.
-   Hextrapolate: Programmers number conversion tool.

### Unknown

The status of the following product on Leopard is unknown:

-   atosym: Address-to-symbol conversion aid for programmers.

### All other products

There are a number of other products which aren't specifically tied to the Mac OS X platform, and so should work on Leopard just as they did under Tiger:

-   Bansshee: protection against SSH dictionary attacks.
-   Walrus: object-oriented templating system written in [Ruby](http://www.wincent.com/wiki/Ruby).
