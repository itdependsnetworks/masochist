[Yet Another Higher Order Messaging Implementation](http://notahat.com/nhcollections) for Objective-C comes to light.

Strong points:

-   Very small and simple; not much code to it
-   Better type checking (via categories) than [most HOM implementations](http://typechecked.net/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/08/thoughts_on_hig.php)

Weak points:

-   Incomplete
-   Doesn't seem to compile/run on Intel
