title: Synergy Advance 0.4 beta 2
tags: blog
---

The second 0.4 beta release of Synergy Advance has been seeded to beta testers. See the [information for beta testers](http://wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2005/04/information_for.php), [how to file a good bug report](http://wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2004/11/how_to_file_a_g.php), [the change log](/a/products/synergy-advance/history/#0.4b2) and [the downloads page](/a/products/synergy-advance/download/).

Note that this is a limited seed release and that nondisclosure (confidentiality) provisions apply. The build is not for public discussion or redistribution, but membership in the beta program is open to anyone who is interested. I am also happy to provide a complimentary Synergy license on request to any beta tester that [purchases a Synergy Advance license](https://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/purchase/).
