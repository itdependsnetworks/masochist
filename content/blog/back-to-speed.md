I've just arrived back in Spain after a period of three months in Australia. I continued working while in Australia, on the trusty 12" PowerBook, but due to poor Internet connectivity I chose not to release any updates while I was away. I am busy merging in the changes that I made in Australia, and you can expect to see some releases soon (this month) with a lot of fixes and improvements. Also, I'll get back to posting regular updates here and on my personal weblog. Thanks for your support!
