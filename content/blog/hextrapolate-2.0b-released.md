The new version of Hextrapolate (formerly WinHex), 2.0, is now in beta testing. The name-change took place to avoid confusion with a Windows product of the same name.

This is a ground-up rewrite of the original WinHex with many new features, bug fixes and enhancements. This is also the first Universal Binary release for Hextrapolate. See the [full changelog](http://wincent.com/a/products/hextrapolate/history/) for all the details.

Hextrapolate licenses can be purchased [here](https://wincent.com/a/products/hextrapolate/purchase/), and you can download the product [here](http://wincent.com/a/products/hextrapolate/download/).
