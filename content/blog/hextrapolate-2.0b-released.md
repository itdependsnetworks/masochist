The new version of [Hextrapolate](https://hex.wincent.com) (formerly WinHex), 2.0, is now in beta testing. The name-change took place to avoid confusion with a Windows product of the same name.

This is a ground-up rewrite of the original WinHex with many new features, bug fixes and enhancements. This is also the first Universal Binary release for Hextrapolate. See the [full changelog](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/hextrapolate/history/) for all the details.

You can read the announcement posted to the [Hextrapolate beta testers mailing list](http://lists.wincent.com/mailman/listinfo/hextrapolate-beta) in [this message](http://lists.wincent.com/pipermail/hextrapolate-beta/2007-April/000000.html) (see also [this correction](http://lists.wincent.com/pipermail/hextrapolate-beta/2007-April/000001.html)).
