title: WinSwitch 3.0b localization pack now available
tags: blog
---

Yesterday I released [WinSwitch 3.0b](http://wincent.dev/a/products/winswitch/) to the world. I've just finished putting together the localization pack for 3.0b, so if you are interested in contributing to the localization effort, head over to the [downloads page](http://wincent.dev/a/products/winswitch/download/) and grab the pack [using this link](http://wincent.dev/download.php?item=WinSwitchLocalizationPack.tar.gz). I also have this [article on localizing](http://wincent.dev/a/knowledge-base/archives/2004/11/localization_on.php) if you want to learn more.

WinSwitch is the most translated of my [products](http://wincent.dev/a/products/), now up to eleven localized languages. All of those (except English, of course) will need to be updated before the 3.0 final release. If you've got some localizing experience and would like to support the project by volunteering a new localization, please step forward and [let me know](http://wincent.dev/a/contact/mail/)!
