I am very pleased to announce the immediate availability of [WinSwitch](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/) version 3.0b. This is a major update to the popular replacement for Apple's Fast User Switching menu which packs in a number of [great new features and bug fixes](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/history/#3.0b). Highlights include a brand [new preferences panel](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/screenshots/) and the ability to set a customizable hot key to take you back to the login window. See [the full list of changes](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/history/#3.0b).

For the technically curious, this release marks the public debut of three frameworks that I have been working on for a long time and which will be used in almost all of my future products (such as [Synergy Advance](http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/), [GetSmart Pro](http://wincent.com/a/products/getsmart-pro/), and a couple of unannounced products that I have nearing completion). The frameworks are WOHotKey (which provides the hot key support), WOBezel (of which you can see the tip of the iceberg in [the new notification window](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/screenshots/)), and WODebug (which provides low-level services and a crash catcher/crash reporter; of course, I don't expect anyone to see the crash reporter, because WinSwitch should never crash!).

WinSwitch is freeware, but I depend on donations to cover the [costs](http://wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2004/11/costs_of_runnin.php) of distribution and development, so please consider [making a small contribution](https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/donate/). I have some wonderful ideas for improving WinSwitch, but I need your financial support to implement them.

If you haven't yet tried WinSwitch yet, head over to the [downloads page](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/download/) and take it for a spin!
