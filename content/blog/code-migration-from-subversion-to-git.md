title: Code migration from Subversion to Git
tags: site blog
---

A couple more codebases have been moved across from the legacy [Subversion](/wiki/Subversion) repositories to new [Git](/wiki/Git) ones over the last week or so:

-   [WinSwitch](/wiki/WinSwitch)
-   [atosym](/wiki/atosym)

A couple of other Git repos were actually set up some months ago but I don't think I mentioned them here on the [blog](/blog):

-   [mkdtemp](http://mkdtemp.rubyforge.org/)
-   [wopen3](/wiki/wopen3)
