So Bansshee is out.

I wrote it [back in April this year](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/04/bansshee_my_ans.php) and since then it has been [performing without skipping a beat](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/04/bansshee_update.php).

It's been running non-stop since I first deployed it. I only reboot the server for kernel updates and the last one of those was just over 87 days ago; since that time Bansshee has been running continuously stopping dozens, hundreds and sometimes even thousands of SSH break-in attempts every day. Not bad for a humble little daemon written in Perl.
