title: 25 years and counting
---

I've been publishing writing on the web for almost 25 years now â€” at least, [the oldest snapshot I can find for a website of mine](https://web.archive.org/web/19981203033112/http://ghurrell.mtx.net:80/docs/gissing.html) dates back to December 3, 1998 (it's possible I published this even earlier, because the footer notes that I wrote the article in "November 1997"). I look back at [those attempts at academic writing](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ghurrell.mtx.net/*) by my 22-year-old-self and sometimes have to grimace at how strained the wording is, but I don't feel _that_ bad about it. I graduated in the end, after all.

Lately, life has been too busy to write anything on here. I have a number of topics I'd like to dip into, but I can't do them justice in the time I'm willing and able to allocate them. So for now, this will have to do.
