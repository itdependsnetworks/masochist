title: Wincent buildtools release
tags: blog
---

I've just made available the [buildtools](http://wincent.com/a/products/buildtools/) package used during the build processes of a number of Wincent products. The included scripts handle or facilitate common build tasks such as applying custom icons to folders, preparing and indexing in-application help, stripping release builds and much more. The tools are free, released under the GPL, but [donations are welcome](https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=win@wincent.com&item_name=buildtools+donation&no_note=1&currency_code=EUR&lc=en).
