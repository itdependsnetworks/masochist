title: Wincent buildtools release
tags: blog
---

I've just made available the [buildtools](http://typechecked.net/a/products/buildtools/) package used during the build processes of a number of Wincent products. The included scripts handle or facilitate common build tasks such as applying custom icons to folders, preparing and indexing in-application help, stripping release builds and much more. The tools are free, released under the GPL, but donations are welcome.
