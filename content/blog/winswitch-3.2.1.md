title: WinSwitch 3.2.1

I've just put a new build of WinSwitch (version 3.2.1) on the server to correct a spurious crash warning that may appear on first launch. If you've already installed 3.2 then there is no need to upgrade unless you continue to see the warning; the spurious warning should appear only once.

See the [previous release announcement](http://typechecked.net/a/news/archives/2006/04/winswitch_32_un.php) for full details.
