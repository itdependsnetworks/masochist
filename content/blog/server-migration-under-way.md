title: Server migration under way

The [server migration](http://typechecked.net/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2008/01/farewell_racksp.php) from Rackspace to INetU is currently underway. My aim is do this very carefully, service by service, and keep downtime to a minimum; hopefully minutes rather than hours.

Just in case there is any interruption during the move, I've just opened [a twitter account](http://twitter.com/wincent) where I'll be posting updates along the way:

-   <http://twitter.com/wincent>

Not really a twitter fan myself — I've always felt that the best place to post that kind of info is on my own weblog — but in a case like this it makes sense to have an offsite feed.
