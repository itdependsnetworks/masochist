title: Call for Bansshee donations
tags: blog

Bansshee is a free, open-source tool to thwart dictionary-based SSH attacks. As a convenience to users there are three domains that resolve to the Bansshee project page. These are coming up for renewal soon (they expire on 11 April 2008) so I'm turning to the public to ask for donations to cover the cost of their ongoing registration.

They're currently registered with [joker.com](https://joker.com/), and the renewal price for each domain is \$12.00. [Last time](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/03/a_call_for_help.php) I made this request help was quick in coming, so I am hoping that the same will be true in this case.

If you'd like to help with the renewal you can send your donation to me via PayPal. My priority will be to keep the dot-org domain alive; the others will follow suit if I receive enough donations.

As was the case last time, the project will continue to survive even if I can't renew the domains, but I'd like to keep providing them if I can.
