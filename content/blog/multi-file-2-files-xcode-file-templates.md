title: Multi-file (2+ files) Xcode file templates

I'm very happy to have discovered that you can set up Xcode file templates that include more than two files. I've just used this to make two new templates, "Objective-C class with tests" and "Objective-C category with tests", which create not only the basic header and implementation files but a matching WOTest test class (header and implementation) as well in a `Tests` subdirectory. Makes it so much easier to do the right thing with regard to unit testing. [Notes here](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Multi-file_Xcode_templates).
