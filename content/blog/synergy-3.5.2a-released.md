Version 3.5.2a of [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy), the lightweight, highly-customizable [iTunes](/wiki/iTunes) controller is now available. This is the latest release in the alpha/experimental series.

This release incorporates changes to the update process when older versions are found running on the system and fixes a window title bug ([bug \#1343](/issues/1343)).

A full changelog appears [here](http://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.5.2a).

You can download the new release from [the download page](http://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/download/) ([direct link](http://typechecked.net/download.php?item=SynergyBeta.zip)) and purchase a license using [this page](https://typechecked.net/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/). Please note that 3.5.2a is not a free update for users who received a free copy of Synergy as part of the MacHeist Giving Tree bundle (see the [MacHeist FAQ](/blog/frequently-asked-questions-about-synergy-and-macheist) for more information).

Also of note was the release of 3.4 (stable series) at the end of June. If you're curious about the difference between the two series and would like to know which one you should use, please see my [blog](/blog) post, "[Clearing up confusion about Synergy version numbers](/blog/clearing-up-confusion-about-synergy-version-numbers)".
