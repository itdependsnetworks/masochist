title: Hextrapolate added to the nightly builds schedule
tags: blog

Hextrapolate has now been added to the [nightly builds schedule](http://wincent.dev/s/nightlies/) and the [first build](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/archives/2007/04/hextrapolate_revision_91.php) is now up (see also the [full list of Hextrapolate nightlies](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/archives/hextrapolate/)).

If you're interested in closely following the development process you may be interested in the nightlog feed, my personal weblog, the Subversion log, and the other resources mentioned [in this summary](http://wincent.dev/s/progress/).

The usual disclaimers apply to the nightly builds:

> Nightly builds are generated once per day by an automated system; they are not official releases and they receive no human testing prior to being uploaded. They are provided with no warranty of any kind; use them at your own risk.

This new addition follows some [improvements](http://wincent.dev/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/04/test_process_im.php) that I've been making to the testing process and which I hope will both speed up development and result in the best quality software possible.
