title: Involuntary Reboot Log #21

So it turns out that [SuperDuper! definitely doesn't produce bootable backups](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/11/using_superdupe.php)Â on [Leopard](http://wincent.com/wiki/Leopard). I had used SuperDuper! to move my old [Tiger](http://wincent.com/wiki/Tiger) install [to a new volume](http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/11/backup_obsessio.php); this was before I found out that SuperDuper! isn't comptaible with Leopard.

Seeing as my SuperDrive isn't supported in Leopard I had no choice but to boot into Tiger when I wanted to watch a DVD last night, so, wondering if the backup would be bootable or not I gingerly rebooted.

Didn't quite work, spewing lots of flickering white text on a black screen; I could see a command prompt but it would get repeatedly painted over by other text. On typing I could only get a single character at a time reflected on the screen before it got repainted over. Tried `reboot`, `shutdown` and all that jazz but eventually things froze and had to hard reset.
