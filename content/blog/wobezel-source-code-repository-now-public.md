I've just released some more source code under the [BSD](/wiki/BSD) license, this time the [WOBezel](/wiki/WOBezel) framework. WOBezel is an [Objective-C](/wiki/Objective-C) framework for [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) which provides things like notification bezels, splash screens, about boxes, and some other basic window-related functionality.

This is part of a general move towards [open source](/wiki/open_source) that I've been working on for a long, long time now. If you're interested to hear about my motivation, see the post I published last month, "[Embracing open source](/blog/embracing-open-source)".

Periodically-updated backup mirrors are already in place at [GitHub](/wiki/GitHub) and [Gitorous](/wiki/Gitorous):
