title: Kagi store prices now set in Euros

A number of changes have just gone live to the [Wincent store](https://wincent.com/s/kagi/) hosted by the Kagi payment processor service:

-   I've switched over to the new Kagi store format which means that customers can now choose to display prices in over a dozen different currencies.
-   The new store is better-looking.
-   The old store format format forced me to set my prices in US dollars; prices are now set in Euros, but you can display and pay using the currency of your choice.
-   The new store will allow me to accept coupon codes and set up special discounts; I'll be publishing news about special offers on this weblog.
-   The move to Euros now means that prices will be kept in sync regardless of whether you choose to pay using Kagi or with PayPal; the only exception is the Synergy single-user license which continues to be significantly cheaper via PayPal due to their lower fees (5€ with PayPal but [10€ with Kagi](https://wincent.com/s/kagi/)).
