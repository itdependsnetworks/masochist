I am very pleased to announce the immediate availability of [WinSwitch](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/) version 3.0. This is a major update to the popular replacement for Apple's Fast User Switching menu which packs in a large number of [great new features and fixes all known issues](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/history/). Highlights that were introduced in the beta include a brand [new preferences panel](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/screenshots/) and the ability to set a customizable hot key to take you back to the login window. See [the full list of changes](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/history/).

WinSwitch is freeware, but I depend on donations to cover the [costs](http://wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2004/11/costs_of_runnin.php) of distribution and development, so please consider [making a contribution](https://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/donate/), no matter how small. I have some wonderful ideas for improving WinSwitch, but I need your financial support to implement them. Over the lifetime of the program, the total donation to download ratio is less than 4 in 1000.

If you haven't yet tried WinSwitch yet, head over to the [downloads page](http://wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/download/) and take it for a spin!
