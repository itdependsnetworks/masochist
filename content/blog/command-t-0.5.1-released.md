Early last month I posted about [a plug-in that I was working on](/blog/bringing-textmate-style-command-t-to-vim) for [VIM](/wiki/VIM). It's a powerful, [open source](/wiki/open_source) file-navigation plug-in inspired by the "Command-T" feature in [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate).

I released the first version of the plug-in soon after and since then I've been quietly uploading updates to the [plug-in's page](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025) at www.vim.org, but I haven't announced them here as I wanted to get some decent screencasts up first.

Well, the screencasts are now up on the [Command-T product page](/products/command-t) so from here on I'll be posting release announcements here.

The latest release is 0.5.1, made available yesterday. This is a maintenance release that fixes a compatibility regression with Ruby 1.9.1.

So, if you're a [VIM](/wiki/VIM) user check out the [screencasts](/products/command-t) and give the plug-in a try. If you'd like to support development you can use [the donations page](/products/command-t/donations) to make a donation, or consider submitting a patch for the project.
